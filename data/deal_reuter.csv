Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, said in May it wanted to use its capital more efficiently. It is currently expanding its U.S. investment banking business. Selling the stake in Jafco would contribute to Nomura's drive to enhance capital efficiency and optimally allocate its management resources, Nomura said. Shares in Nomura closed down 1.5 percent at 650.1 yen, while Jafco shares ended up more than 15 percent at 5,260 yen, their highest since October 2015. The benchmark Nikkei .N225 average index fell 0.6 percent. Nomura sold its 8.48 million shares, or 17.6 percent stake, in Jafco, at 4,560 yen ($41) per share, raising 38.7 billion yen ($348 million), Nomura said in a statement. Nomura Research Institute Ltd (4307.T), in which Nomura holds a 37.2 percent stake, tendered to sell 4.95 million Jafco shares, Jafco said. Jafco said it was buying 13.4 million shares from the two tenders for 61.3 billion yen ($551.21 million). The deal would generate for Nomura a pretax profit of about 9 billion yen ($80.9 million), to be booked in the July-September period, Nomura said. In a separate statement, Jafco said it would tender 5 million shares in Nomura Research Institute, adding that if it sold all the shares it planned to book a gain of 18.4 billion yen ($165.5 million) in the July-September period.In May, Nomura Holdings began unofficial talks with Japan Post Holdings Co (6178.T) to sell a stake in group company Nomura Real Estate Holdings (3231.T), a source told Reuters.The deal broke down in June. Nomura Real Estate said Japan Post was no longer considering buying a stake. After the Jafco sale, Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura told a conference call Nomura was not planning to sell holdings in Nomura Real Estate and Nomura Research Institute, in which it has 34.1 percent and 37.2 percent stakes, respectively.

Drei said on Friday the merged group, led by Hong Kong-based Hutchison, would have around 1 billion euros in annual sales and four million mobile, landline and internet lines.This compares with 3.4 million lines and 2016 revenue of 2.6 billion euros at Telekom Austria's A1 unit, which has so far had a monopoly on these combined telecoms services in the country with a population of 8.7 million. This is a clear challenge to (Telekom Austria's) A1, said Drei Austria Chief Executive Jan Trionow at a news conference.We want to move closer to A1 and will certainly not stop once we've reached them. A1 has a larger share of the lucrative market for business customers. Trionow said it was too early to give longer-term earnings and sales guidance. The new management structure was also still being discussed.Tele2 as a brand will be withdrawn from the Austrian market within the next 12 months, he said. Austria is a highly competitive market for telecoms companies, especially in mobile broadband. All major operators, including Deutsche Telekom's Austrian unit, have an aggressive pricing policy.Hutchison and Slim's America Movil became key players in the Austrian telecoms market in 2013 and 2014 with the Asian group buying France Telecom's Orange Austria and Slim becoming the majority owner of former state monopoly Telekom Austria.Both groups invested about a billion euros at the time, hoping for further growth opportunities elsewhere in Europe. As these hopes did not materialize, digital broadband has become the major battleground. The Drei Austria chief said the new group will play an integral part in providing high-speed internet for companies in Austria after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned recently that progress was lagging most rich countries.The government wants companies to have access to high-speed broadband internet even in the remotest parts of the Alpine country by 2020. Hutchison, the number one in mobile internet and mobile entertainment services in Austria, plans to expand its expertise to business customers and generate more than 25 percent of revenue from them in the medium term.At the merged group, that ratio would currently be 22 percent. The deal is expected to close this year, pending regulatory approval. Editing by Alexander Smith and Keith Weir"

Once Asia's largest commodities trading house, Singapore-listed Noble is a shadow of what it was during the boom years, when it snapped up assets from sugar mills to coal mines and expanded globally to rival Glencore (GLEN.L) and Trafigura. In a dramatic overhaul announced on Wednesday, it sold its U.S. gas and power business to a Swiss-based peer, Mercuria Energy Group, for $248 million, started a process to sell its oils liquids unit and announced plans for up to $1 billion of disposals over the next two years. It also flagged a $1.3 billion writedown, leading to a quarterly loss of up to $1.8 billion on a more conservative balance sheet valuation. You are essentially getting back to a contract book that's worth $1.2 billion and meanwhile you have debt at $3.3 billion. So that's clearly not sustainable, said Andy DeVries, New York-based analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm. You can't asset sale your way out of this. You can't grow the earnings out of this. You need a change in the capital structure. It's essential. Sources close to the company and investors said the business remains hemmed in by financing constraints - a major issue for trading houses - and has lost many traders, analysts and managers over the past months, despite cash offers to keep key staff until December. Recruiters cite high-profile departures, including veterans in Noble's U.S. aluminum business. Other exits include the company's head of the quantitative strategists team, who confirmed he left Singapore last week to return to his native Iceland. Its head of forex and rates left after an eight-year stint and its Asia treasury chief quit. Noble's chief iron ore analyst, Gueorgui Pirinski, joined rival Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) in May. Noble declined to comment for this story. Commodity trading is a people business and relies heavily on the contacts and expertise of its traders and analysts. In theory, Noble had a very large oil trading business that was worth a lot of money, said CreditSights' DeVries. In reality, they lost most of the key traders in that business. It is very bare bones and they are selling the remaining bones. Red October Noble was thrust into the spotlight in February 2015 when previously obscure Iceberg Research accused it of overstating its assets by billions of dollars, which Noble rejected. In 2015, consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers found Noble had complied with international accounting rules. But as far back as January 2016, Noble's founder and then chairman, Richard Elman, told Reuters in an interview that the firm needed to go back to being modest and cautious and economical. After Wednesday, the company's latest overhaul, its shares slid by nearly 49 percent, valuing the group at less than $400 million - far below its $10 billion peak. The stock has slumped 75 percent this year. A representative of Iceberg told Reuters: Noble is facing the perfect storm for a trader - prohibitive cost of funding, both counterparties and banks are cutting their exposure, many traders have left. It is simply not possible to get out of this hole. Noble's key 2020 bond USG6542TAE1=TE also fell, trading down half a point at 32.5/36.25 cents on the dollar. The latest bond, issued in March and due in 2022 < XS157733877=TE>, has slumped to 32.9/35.55 - less than a third of its value in little over 4 months. S&P; Global Ratings in May cut Noble's corporate credit ratings to junk status, warning of a default. Analysts expect Noble's latest plan to mark the prelude to talks with bondholders. On one hand the asset sales can arrest an immediate liquidity crunch, but on the other hand it means that the large chunk of the core business will be gone, said Chris Park, an analyst at Moody's. The question is if it can service its remaining debt even if it can reduce the short term liquidity issues. Last month, Noble extended a key debt deadline to Oct. 20, providing a lifeline to the company, and it said on Wednesday it was in still talking with banks. Previously a large player in metals, agriculture, oil, natural gas, iron ore and coal, market participants say Noble has for months been largely reduced to trading physical coal supply contracts it has with customers, including deals to ship thermal coal from Indonesia's Kalimantan to clients in North Asia. While other merchants, including its bigger European rival Glencore, have recovered from the 2015/2016 commodities slump, Noble's decline has been steep. But it woes do not appear to pose a wider risk of contagion to the sector. They are virtually absent from physical oil or liquefied natural gas. The capital requirements for them are just too high, and the counterparty risk to engage with them is too high for us, said one energy trader who used to regularly deal with Noble. It's sad to see. The market lost a major participant, and I know guys there. It's not an easy situation for them to be in.

The value of mergers and acquisitions involving American companies in China dropped 32 percent to just $523 million in the six months to June 30 from $771 million in the same period last year, and were down 87 percent from $4 billion in the first six months of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bankers and lawyers involved in deal making say that increasing signs of trade friction between Washington and Beijing are acting as a deterrent. The tensions were reflected at a meeting earlier this month when officials from the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. American companies do not want to make acquisitions in an environment where they could get caught in crossfire between the two governments, these sources said. That could happen if, for example, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese steel and other products and Beijing retaliated with its own action against American goods or entities. (For a graphic on U.S. M&A; in China, click tmsnrt.rs/2gWn98u) That in turn leads to the danger that American companies won’t be able to take full advantage of China’s still buoyant economic growth of just under 7 percent a year, adding further to the stresses in the trade and investment relationship between the two countries.The new norm for China and the U.S. is to be at odds on trade issues. As of now, they are having huge differences with regards to the steel industry, huge differences with regards to trade imbalance, said Roy Zou, a Beijing partner at law firm Hogan Lovells. “I don't see a big increase in U.S. investments in China.” China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) did not respond to Reuters faxed request for comment on the drop in U.S. acquisitions. The decline is happening at a time when Chinese deals in the U.S. are still rising, though opposition in Washington to certain kinds of Chinese purchases on national security grounds is also increasing and could add to tensions.Foreign Firms Complain European companies' deal making has also been declining but at a slower pace. Their acquisitions in China in the first half of this year were worth $223 million, against $268 million in the same period last year.Foreign firms have complained for some time about not being offered a level playing field in China. Among their concerns are restrictions on foreign ownership in key sectors – including finance and technology – and various regulations that favor domestic firms over foreign rivals.And all of this can make them think twice about pulling the trigger on a major acquisition, trade experts said.\ Foreign investors face explicit and implicit ownership restrictions in the most attractive sectors, and they are also not able to participate in the restructuring and consolidation of ailing industries, said Rhodium Group economist Thilo Hanemann, who analyses China’s international investment position. FILE PHOTO: China's President Xi Jinping arrives for the opening ceremony of B20 Summit ahead of G20 Summit, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, September 3, 2016.Aly Song/File PhotoThe American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said in its annual China Business Report published on July 12 that the Chinese government needed to halt policies and regulations that favor domestic firms over foreign businesses.The lobby group complained of long-established systemic inequities, in the report, which was based on responses from 426 AmCham member companies in China. While buyers of assets in China have faced many such challenges before, they haven’t usually had to do so against such a backdrop of trade tensions and wider political uncertainty. There is a lot of grandstanding going on between the two countries, said a senior M&A; banker at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong. Not many would like to deploy a couple of billion dollars now when you are not sure of the regulatory landscape and what shape and form it would take. This picture is further complicated by the approaching 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, this autumn. The gathering is expected to lead to a consolidation of President Xi Jinping’s power. Many of the organs of the party and government are focused on making sure the Congress, which is held every five years, goes off without a hitch and that there isn‘t any kind of economic or political schism in the months leading up to it.FILE PHOTO: The logo of Morgan Stanley is seen at an office building in Zurich, Switzerland September 22, 2016.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoChinese economic bureaucracy is now dominated by a desire to manage systemic risk in preparation for the upcoming 19th Party Congress, said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.Any policies or reforms to be adopted after the Congress are still unknown, he said, adding last week his firm advised a U.S. private equity fund to postpone plans for China investments until regulatory issues are clarified. The Chinese authorities’ increasing scrutiny of some of the most acquisitive Chinese companies of recent years, such as the HNA Group Co Ltd, which has led to a slowdown in their deal making, has added to the uncertainty. This is focusing attention on the opaque nature of their ownership and finances and may make them less appealing as deal makers, whether as buyers and sellers of assets, or as partners in any transactions. There have been 17 announced acquisitions of companies in China by U.S. firms this year, compared to 39 in whole of 2016. The average value is down to $43 million this year from $73 million in 2008, when U.S. acquisitions hit an all-time high of $12 billion.Some trade experts worry that a more hawkish Washington approach to the national security risks of proposed Chinese investments in the U.S. could easily trigger retaliation from Beijing. The sense we get from talking to our clients is there is concern as to whether anti-trust policies (in China) could now be used to discriminate against foreign enterprises, said Mustafa Hadi, head of disputes and international arbitration for Greater China and North Asia, at advisory and consultancy firm Berkeley Research Group. In the financial sector in particular, there are concerns that some deals and expectations of reform could get derailed if Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate, according to people familiar with the situation. JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to set up a new joint venture with a local partner in China, while Morgan Stanley is looking to further increase its stake in its mainland China investment-banking operations after already raising it to 49 percent this year, people with direct knowledge of the discussions have said.

Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing firm which counts SoftBank as an investor, could join Ofo's new fundraising round，the sources told Reuters. Ofo could reach a valuation of close to $3 billion after the funding, one of the sources said. Ofo and Mobike, China's two largest bike-sharing startups, each has raised over $1 billion since late last year in a cash war to expand market share at home and overseas.Ofo is seeking fresh capital less than a month after raising more than $700 million from investors led by Alibaba Group and two others, following rival Mobike, which in June announced a $600 million investment led by Tencent Holdings. The latest Ofo investment plan has not been finalised, the sources said, who declined to be identified as the discussions are private. SoftBank and Didi declined to comment. Ofo didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. Ofo did not disclose its valuation in the last funding round. Dai Wei, Ofo's founder and CEO, had said in April the firm was valued at upwards of $2 billion. Mobike's valuation reached around $2.7 billion-$3.0 billion after the June funding round, according to three sources close to the startup. And it is also open to raising new money, one of them said. Mobike declined to comment. Ofo said earlier this month it plans to deploy 20 million bikes and expand its service to 200 cities in 20 countries by the end of 2017. It said it has connected over 6.5 million bikes to riders in 150 cities across five countries, generating more than 25 million transactions daily. Mobike has said it has over 5 million bikes in more than 100 cities in the world. The company said on Wednesday it would start offering bike rides in Italy. The rapid fundraising and broad expansion plans of the bike-sharing companies are worrying some investors. We hope they (the recent funding rounds) wouldn't lead to endless bike piling and price competition, said a venture capitalist who invests in China's bike-sharing apps and could not be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. China currently has at least 10 operational bike-sharing apps. Local regulators have raised concerns that bikes could add to congestion on the streets. The bikes are also easily stolen or vandalized, adding extra costs to the companies. Didi's Influence Didi, already an investor in Ofo, has been increasing its influence at the company. Three of its senior executives joined Ofo this week, according to local media. Ofo told local media on Wednesday it had named Fu Qiang, a former senior vice-president of Didi, executive president of the company but did not confirm the hiring of the other two.For SoftBank, which recently launched a near $100 billion technology fund, an investment in Ofo would be another bet on China's sharing-based economy that has already attracted billions in venture capital. The Japanese conglomerate in May agreed to invest $5 billion in Didi, putting an over $50 billion valuation on the Chinese company.

Glencore has long wanted Rio Tinto's Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) but Yancoal Australia was confirmed last month as the preferred bidder for Rio's Australian Coal & Allied division, which owns the mines. Glencore said on Thursday, however, it would buy a 16.6 percent stake in HVO from Yancoal and 32.4 percent from Mitsubishi Corp, and then form a joint venture to run the mines with Yancoal, which will keep a 51 percent stake. Yancoal's Chinese parent company Yanzhou said on Wednesday its board had approved the transfer of the 16.6 percent interest in the HVO joint venture, without naming the buyer, provided the Rio sale was completed. HVO is widely regarded as the more valuable of the two Hunter Valley coal complexes that Yancoal is set to acquire from Rio Tinto for $2.7 billion after Glencore lost out in a bidding war with the Chinese-owned coal miner. Glencore wants the assets that adjoin operations it owns in the Hunter Valley. It first tried to acquire Coal & Allied in 2015, when Rio Tinto made it clear that coal was no longer part of its growth strategy. Analysts said Glencore planned to blend the HVO coal with coal from its existing operations to customize shipments to power-generating customers. Thursday's statement says Glencore will be the exclusive marketing agent for Hunter Valley coal sales into Japan, South Korea and all other countries except China, Taiwan (with certain exclusions), Thailand and Malaysia. It also gets the right to nominate candidates for the HVO general manager, while Yancoal will nominate candidates for financial controller. Glencore is already the world's largest exporter of sea-traded thermal coal, with interests in 28 mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa. Under Thursday's announcement, Glencore will pay $1.139 billion in cash and a 27.9 percent share of $240 million in non-contingent royalties over five years, as well as subscribing to $300 million worth of shares Yancoal is selling as part of a capital increase to fund its Rio Tinto deal. The joint venture deal is expected to be completed within six months. Mitsubishi, which said in June it would sell its HVO stake to whoever won the Rio assets, said on Friday that negotiations to sell its interest and over transfer marketing rights were still underway.We have not made any agreement with Glencore on a sale of our 32.4 percent stake in HVO, including marketing rights in Japan, a company spokesman said. We will talk to Glencore and Yancoal on the deal, he said. Glencore declined further comment. Analysts said Glencore and Yancoal both gained as Glencore would get the assets it wanted most and Yancoal would reduce the cost of its deal with Rio. BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Sterck calculated the price paid by Glencore would be about 8 percent lower than the implied valuation of Yancoal's bid, though Glencore was only getting a minority stake as well as buying Yancoal shares. Glencore's share price rose 0.3 percent on Thursday, recovering from a decline in early trade after the company cut its 2017 production targets.

Delta, which holds a 3.2 percent stake in China Eastern, is also buying a 10 percent stake in Air France KLM.China Eastern said its 375 million euro ($438 million) investment in Air France KLM was compatible with the government's Belt and Road initiative which seeks to improve trade and transport links between Asia and Europe.The parties will work together to build the China-Europe main routes market, China Eastern said. China Eastern, along with rivals China Southern Airlines Co and Air China Ltd have been expanding their global route networks as Chinese outbound tourism and trade investment increases. While HNA, the parent company of China's largest private operator Hainan Airlines, has taken stakes in a number of Western airlines, none of China's three largest state carriers have done so. Air China has a cross-shareholding with Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. There has been interest from state-owned airlines to buy foreign airlines but those deals were never completed. So yes, this is the first, said Will Horton, senior analyst at Australian aviation consultancy CAPA.China Eastern may be different since it is part of state owned enterprise reform, he said, adding that Delta might have guided China Eastern on the equity investment. Beijing has been advocating ownership reforms at its state-owned companies in a bid to revamp the country's bloated state sector and help such firms to become more competitive globally.Air France KLM said in a statement that the alliance would give it a European leadership position in Shanghai, the main business travel market in China.

The shake-up is designed to strengthen carriers on the lucrative North Atlantic, where low-cost entrants have shaken up the market, and comes as Britain negotiates to leave the European Union, creating a tangle over Heathrow access. The realignment coincides with a deal for Air France-KLM to deepen its commercial ties with China Eastern (600115.SS) to build what it described as the European leg of a global network. The new 15-year partnership combines existing joint-ventures between firstly Air France-KLM, Delta and Alitalia, and secondly between Delta and Virgin Atlantic, Air France-KLM said. What it does is brings together the missing piece of that triangle: the missing link between Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic, Atmosphere Research Group analyst Henry Harteveldt said, noting Delta's existing ventures with both carriers.Airlines have few options for traditional cross-border consolidation because of complex national ownership rules. The role of Alitalia in the new alliance is dependent on what will happen in the months to come, with an administrator currently seeking offers for the struggling carrier. Air France-KLM said one option could be for Alitalia to cooperate as an associate partner. At the same time as forging the expanded alliance, Air France-KLM will buy 31 percent of Virgin Atlantic [VA.UL] from Richard Branson's Virgin Group for around 220 million pounds ($287 million). Delta and China Eastern will each acquire a 10 percent stake in Air France-KLM by subscribing to new shares through reserved capital increases totalling 751 million euros ($877 million). Delta shares traded down just under 1 percent, weighed by disappointing third-quarter outlooks by rival U.S. carriers. Antitrust Concerns The deal - which is subject to regulatory approval - would give the partners a stronger position on the North Atlantic market with a combined 27 percent of capacity, ahead of rivals, according to Flightglobal Schedules data. What it gives the ability to do is manage capacity and pricing more broadly on the Atlantic, assuming they get anti-trust immunity, Robert Mann, analyst at R.W. Mann & Co, said. But James Halstead, a managing partner at Aviation Strategy, said the deal raised questions about Virgin Atlantic's traffic rights from the UK after Britain's planned exit from the European Union, since it would no longer be a mainly UK firm. The deal makes Air France-KLM the second largest shareholder in Virgin Atlantic after Delta, which owns a 49 percent stake, and reduces Virgin Group's stake to 20 percent.The rules in front of us today are European; this (deal) complies with those. We will deal with any changes when they come, Virgin Atlantic chief commercial officer Shai Weiss said. The Brexit vote has left the region's carriers looking for ways to protect traffic rights and shareholder structures even though the outcome of future negotiations is unclear. John Grant of JG Aviation Consultants said the deal could prompt other creative solutions in ownership structures and equity shares in the coming months.Additional reporting by Alana Wise, Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Andrew Callus and Elaine Hardcastle"

The property, designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, is known for its Sky Garden, which has become a tourist attraction. Land Securities, Britain's largest listed property developer, said it would receive 641 million pounds from the sale. It said it would return 475 million pounds to shareholders, with the rest used to repay debt.

Advent bought the restaurant from private equity firm Freeman Spogli & Co, which acquired it in 2011. Advent invested in First Watch because it has attractive menu items and exceptional customer service, said Tricia Patrick, a managing director at the private equity firm. Founded in 1983 in Pacific Grove, California, the business operates under the brands First Watch and The Egg & I across 26 states, with a heavy presence in Florida, Texas, Ohio, Colorado and Arizona. The 200 First Watch restaurants and 90 The Egg & I restaurants serve breakfast, brunch and lunch until 2:30 p.m.They offer traditional breakfast items like bacon and omelets, as well as trendier, healthy items like avocado toast and quinoa bowls. Breakfast is the fastest-growing meal in the dining industry. Premium coffee chains like Starbucks Corp have made breakfast out more common. It is also cheaper and quicker than other meals for diners tight on time and money. Diners tend to be steadfast in their breakfast habits, creating a reliable business. Growth in the industry has attracted investment, most notably by JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family. Earlier this year, it acquired café chain Panera for $7.2 billion, adding to its empire of coffee and food chains that also includes Caribou Coffee and Krispy Kreme. Fast-food restaurants have also jumped onto the breakfast bandwagon. McDonald's Corp in 2015 added an all-day breakfast menu, and Yum! Brands Inc's Taco Bell last year added a $1 breakfast menu.

Divesting the unit, dubbed Talcott Resolution, would help Hartford recycle capital, allowing it to shed a business that no longer writes new contracts and focus on more profitable, non-life insurance parts of its operations. Atlas has prevailed in an auction for Talcott Resolution, two sources said. While there is no certainty that the negotiations will be successful, a deal could come as early as next month, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Hartford declined to comment, while Atlas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Many insurance firms, struggling to maintain pay-outs at a time of low interest rates, have been placing their annuities businesses into run-off units such as Talcott Resolution - whereby no new policies are written and existing ones are managed until maturity. Often, these units have subsequently been sold. Financial investors such as private equity firms have been buyers, aiming to squeeze out greater returns on these policies by measures including cutting administrative costs. In its second-quarter earnings which were released earlier on Thursday, Hartford said Talcott Resolution's net income was $105 million in the second quarter, almost flat to the corresponding three months of 2016, as declining core earnings were offset by lower costs. Reflecting the run-off nature of the unit, individual variable annuity and fixed annuity contract as of June 30 had declined 10 percent and 6 percent respectively on the same point of last year. No further details were given. Should the agreement be secured to sell Talcott Resolutionto Atlas, it would be the latest in a string of such deals.

SCANA Corp (SCG.N) and its partner, state-owned utility Santee Cooper, said Toshiba will make the payments in installments beginning in October and ending in September 2022. Toshiba's Westinghouse Electric Co filed for bankruptcy in March, overwhelmed by the cost overruns at the VC Summer plant in South Carolina and a similar unfinished nuclear project known as Vogtle in Georgia. The projects are years behind schedule. The agreement allows Toshiba and its Westinghouse unit to exit the nuclear construction business and caps Toshiba's liability for guaranteeing that Westinghouse complete the VC Summer contract.Toshiba reached a similar agreement for $3.7 billion in June with the utilities, led by a unit of Southern Co (SO.N), that own the Vogtle project. Toshiba has warned that losses from Westinghouse threaten its future and it is considering bids for its flash memory chip unit, worth around $18 billion, to raise capital. The owners of the VC Summer project said on Thursday they expect the cost of completing the project will materially exceed Westinghouse's estimates and the payments due from Toshiba. They said they hope to decide soon whether they will continue with the two projects, modify them or abandon them. Westinghouse is expected to deliver this week a five-year business plan to its lender, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management (APO.N). That plan will help shape bids for Westinghouse, which has attracted the interest of U.S. private equity firms. As part of that plan, Westinghouse is expected to reach an agreement with SCANA under which it will continue to provide engineering and other services. Westinghouse has a similar agreement in place with the owners of the Vogtle plant. Westinghouse asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, New York, on Wednesday to give it until Dec. 6 to file a plan of reorganization. The company said it needed more time in part due to talks with SCANA. The request will be heard by the court on Sept. 7. The Georgia and South Carolina plants were the first new nuclear power projects in the United States in three decades. However, the projects have been dogged by design problems, disagreements with regulators and poor quality work by Westinghouse's partners.

The termination of the negotiations shows that banks are still reluctant to finance leveraged buyouts of large, mature technology companies at hefty valuations. It follows unsuccessful attempts earlier this year by Citrix Systems Inc, another business software maker, to go private. The negotiations collapsed after CA told BMC that it expected the deal to take at least 18 months to close once signed, because it anticipated a thorough review by antitrust regulators - especially regarding overlap in the two companies' mainframe businesses, the sources said. CA asked BMC to guarantee it will have the acquisition financing available until the deal closes, the sources added. BMC countered that it would be very difficult to get banks to extend debt financing commitments for as long as 18 months, according to the sources.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations were confidential. CA and BMC declined to comment. CA shares fell 10.2 percent to close at $31.10 on Thursday, after the Wall Street Journal first reported that the talks with BMC had ended.

There has been a flurry of dealmaking for fiber assets, as growing demand from U.S. businesses for data transmission has fueled a revival in fiber optic services and is pushing large telecommunication companies to bulk up in fiber. Earlier this month, tower operator Crown Castle International Corp (CCI.N) said it would buy Lightower Fiber Networks for $7.1 billion, in a bid to boost its data traffic capabilities. No deal between WideOpenWest and Verizon is certain and negotiations could still fall apart, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Another buyer could still emerge for the asset, the sources added. WideOpenWest, which has market capitalization of around $1.4 billion and went public in May, is working with a financial adviser to explore a sale of the unit, the people said.WideOpenWest did not respond to a request for comment. Verizon declined to comment.Since 2014, WideOpenWest has built about 1,200 miles of fiber in the Chicago market for a leading wireless carrier, according to a corporate filing. The sources identified this carrier as Verizon. Verizon uses WideOpenWest's fiber system in Chicago for backhaul, which is the data transfer of mobile traffic over wired lines, according to the sources. While it is under a long-term contract with the wireless carrier, WideOpenWest had said it expected it would find more business customers to use the fiber.Verizon views fiber as critical for its next generation 5G wireless technology and has been testing a 5G fixed wireless service with equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) before a commercial launch as early as 2018. Verizon has also said it would evaluate opportunities to build out or buy fiber on a market-by-market basis.

His hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has been building a position in ADP using money raised recently for a new investment, they said. ADP and a spokesman for Ackman, Fran McGill, declined to comment. As speculation mounted that Ackman, one of the hedge fund industry's most prominent activist investors, was buying shares ADP's stock price surged more than 16.5 percent to $120 before closing at $115.63.The move is especially noteworthy since the company has little debt. At the same time some of its competitors like Workday Inc (WDAY.N) and Equifax Inc (EFX.N) lost ground. The stock move underscores just how much investors believe the 51-year-old investor can push management to perform better even after his fund has suffered two years of losses. News of the stake was first reported by Bloomberg. Ackman had been hinting for weeks that his investment team was close to making a new bet on what he called a classic Pershing Square-type of business: one that is simple, predictable and free cash flow generating. But he has been mum on the name, likely to prevent other investors from stepping in front of him and making potentially lucrative trades. After a humiliating bet in 2015 on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) led to heavy losses at Pershing Square, Ackman said in May that he was poised to go on a great investment run as he and his team return to basics.And a bet on ADP could be exactly that, a company his investment team knows well after Pershing Square previously owned it between 2009 and 2011.For Pershing Square, this would be wading into known waters, said a person familiar with the hedge fund and its investment style, adding this is not Valeant. One of Ackman's signature moves has been to suggest -- either gently or forcefully -- that management needs to be overhauled at his target companies and Thursday's price movement at ADP indicates investors expect the same here. At Air Products and Chemical Inc (APD.N), former CEO John McGlade quickly stepped down after Ackman raised money in the summer of 2013 and unveiled the bet a few weeks later. He also replaced CEOs at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N). At Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), an investment which has hurt Pershing Square so far this year, the co-CEO stepped down and Ackman's firm got two board seats. Ackman has previously raised special purpose vehicles which have been successful in the bets on Air Products and Burger King. Ackman's hedge fund is off roughly 2 percent through the middle of July.

As France's most avowedly pro-business leader in decades, few would have predicted the former investment banker's first big move in the corporate sector would be a nationalization, even if the government says it will only be temporary. However, his action, which added further strain to France's relationship with Italy, fits with the interventionist style of other postwar French leaders. It also crosses into the defense sector, where many national governments prefer to wield influence over ownership. The Italian state-owned shipbuilder Fincantieri (FCT.MI) had reached an agreement in May to pay 79.5 million euros ($93.20 million) for two-thirds of STX France, which is being sold because of the collapse of its South Korean parent, STX. This week it rejected a French government proposal to settle for 50-50 ownership instead. That prompted the French state, which had a minority stake, to exercise pre-emption rights to buy out other shareholders before those rights expire at the end of the month, in effect giving Paris more time to come up with another solution. Related CoverageFrench shipyard move 'incomprehensible' says angry ItalyThis decision is in line with the economic strategy that we want to build with the president of the Republic and the prime minister, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire told a news conference. We want to free up France's exceptional productive capacities and protect our strategic interests, he said, adding that the 50-50 ownership offer was still on the table and that he would visit Rome on Tuesday. While Italy's government warmly welcomed the election of Macron in May, viewing the pro-European centrist as someone who could help Rome on an array of issues, the STX move added to other decisions that have upset it.Macron's talks this week with Libyan leaders irritated Rome, which had previously taken the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former North African colony, and was already disappointed by the new president's migration policies. Incomprehensible The STX nationalization also goes to the heart of Italy's long-held view that French companies' acquisitions on its territory are a one-way street. Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Industry Minister Carlo Calenda called France's decision to nationalise the shipyard grave and incomprehensible. Nationalism and protectionism are not an acceptable basis for establishing relations between two great European countries, they said in a joint statement. The prospect of a Fincantieri takeover had raised fears in France about jobs at the Saint-Nazaire site, and the government was also concerned about the strategic importance of the yard, the only one in the country big enough to build aircraft carriers and other large warships. The Saint-Nazaire shipyards are not destined to remain under state control, Le Maire said. The pre-emption decision is temporary and should give us the time to negotiate in the best conditions. The decision, which was welcomed by French politicians of all political stripes, flies in the face of any expectations that Macron, who in his former post as economy minister sought to liberalise swathes of the economy, would break with the French state's tradition of intervention in business. Even while economy minister, Macron forced through a shareholder vote that increased the government's power over carmaker Renault. Since becoming president in May, he has also forced carmakers to help fund a failing parts manufacturer.Additional reporting by Myriam Rivet and Ingrid Melander; Editing by Kevin Liffey"

The sale of the reactor unit is conditional on a satisfactory audit of Areva's foundry Creusot Forge, which has been closed last year following the discovery of manufacturing flaws and falsification of documentation.An Areva spokesman said that the foundry had just produced a new component after months of inactivity. The component will now be tested and analysed and Areva hopes that nuclear regulator ASN will give the green light to restart the plant this autumn.Two weeks ago, Areva said the state had completed a 2 billion euro capital increase in legacy parent company Areva SA.Following the sale of New Areva NP to EDF and the creation of NewCo - which will focus on uranium mining, nuclear fuel production and nuclear waste handling - Areva SA will be left with managing the EPR OL3 nuclear power plant construction project in Finland, which has been beset by a series of delays and extra costs.The French government, which owns more than 92 percent of Areva's capital following the capital operations, said earlier this month that it will buy up the remaining shares at 4.5 euros per share and then delist the company.Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Ingrid Melander"

We won't be indulging in any large-scale M&A.; I'm even more convinced it's extremely risky and makes little sense, CEO Francesco Starace said in a conference call on Thursday. Bankers and analysts have said European utilities are ready for a new wave of mergers. Sources told Reuters recently that Spain's Gas Natural had contacted Portuguese rival Energias de Portugal (EDP) about a 35 billion euro tie-up to create Europe's fourth biggest utility. The creation of a new Iberian power champion could threaten the dominance of Enel and France's EDF (EDF.PA) on Europe's power market and could unleash a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the region. I see no value in big deals, Starace said. Enel, Europe's biggest utility in terms of market value, paid around 39 billion euros to take control of Spanish utility Endesa eight years ago. The state-controlled utility, which carries some 38 billion euros of debt, runs an asset rotation program - selling some assets to buy others that may offer potentially higher returns. In November it said it would reinvest about 2 billion euros of proceeds from asset sales in bolt-on acquisitions. We are in advanced talks to sell 3 assets in the second half of the year which should raise around 600-700 million euros, Starace said. Enel is looking to its grids and green power businesses to drive growth, especially in emerging markets. On Thursday the utility stuck to its full-year targets after core earnings in the first half fell, partly on drought conditions that affected power production in Spain and Italy. The company said if its hydroelectric production had been normal its core earnings would have been 250 million euros more. The outlook is very encouraging, Starace said when asked about guidance for the next two years. Enel is targeting ordinary core earnings of 16.2 billion euros in 2018 and 17.2 billion euros in 2019.

The Nordstrom family's decision to offer these concessions underscores the apprehension of investors over leveraged buyouts of department store chains, as private equity-owned peer Neiman Marcus Group Inc now struggles with its debt pile amid the rise of internet shopping and changing consumer tastes. The family's move has been successful in reinvigorating talks with potential partners, five sources said this week. Leonard Green & Partners LP, Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR & Co LLP are among the private equity firms in talks with the Nordstrom family members, according to the sources. In its bid to raise around $1 billion in equity from outside investors, the Nordstrom family has also reached out to sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, and firms that invest exclusively on behalf of rich families, the sources added.One possibility being explored is offering potential partners preferred equity in the deal, so that they reap more dividends out of the company's cash flow or they get paid first if there is a stock sale in the future, the sources said. The Nordstrom family members are also contemplating using $7 billion to $8 billion in debt to finance their bid, some of the sources added.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Representatives for Nordstrom and the Nordstrom family, as well as Leonard Green, did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while KKR and Apollo declined to comment. Seattle-based Nordstrom, which has a market capitalization of approximately $8 billion, said in June that the family group, which owns 31.2 percent of the 116-year-old retailer, was studying ways to take the company private. The Nordstrom family is hoping to make investments that will make some of its stores more popular with customers, but would likely be unpopular with the company's shareholders in the short term, one of the sources said. Making those investments as a private company would therefore be easier, the source added. These initiatives would include investing in e-commerce, closing underperforming stores and investing in top locations, and expanding its successful discount shopping chain, Nordstrom Rack, according to the source. Nordstrom operates 354 stores, including 122 full-line stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Out of those, 221 are Nordstrom Rack stores. Its Seattle flagship location, modeled after famous European department stores, has restaurants, bars and pop up shops. Nordstrom is also working on a flagship location on Manhattan's West 57th street in New York. Nordstrom has long been viewed as the jewel of the department store industry. Its affordable high-end price point has distinguishes it from peers such as Macy's Inc, without making it too exclusive. Still, like all of its peers, it has seen its stock and same-stores sales fall as customers change their shopping habits.Neiman Marcus, which is owned by buyout firm Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, has been working with a financial restructuring adviser this year to cope with its $4.7 billion debt pile, with much being the legacy of its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013.

High Times is one of few household names in the cannabis industry, said High Times Chief Executive Adam Levin, who will continue to run the company post-merger.

High Times expects to list by October on Nasdaq, but it is unclear what the ticker will be, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.The source wished to remain anonymous because he is not allowed to speak to the media about the deal.

However, this listing creates an opportunity for retail investors in a company that is close to the sale of cannabis, but not directly involved in it. This is a market that is growing at a 27 percent annual growth rate, said Troy Dayton, chief executive officer of the Arcview Group, a cannabis investment and research firm. The market is expected to exceed $22.6 billion in revenue in 2021, up from $6.7 billion in 2016, according to Arcview. That demand continues to grow despite efforts by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to roll back federal protections for medical marijuana, Dayton said.While there is some saber rattling at the federal level, more states keep passing laws, Dayton said. In November, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada passed laws to allow marijuana use for adults. The train has left the station.

A final decision on the venue for what is expected to be the world's biggest IPO and is targeted to raise $100 billion will be taken by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who is overseeing Saudi Arabia's radical economic reforms, they said. Listing five percent of Aramco is a centerpiece of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to diversify beyond oil and financial considerations will not be the only factor in its decision, with Saudi authorities also taking the interests of shareholders and the company into account, the sources added. The advisers' views on the relative merits of London and New York for the listing are being considered by Aramco and a final proposal could be presented to the government in the fourth quarter, the sources said. London's chances of winning the multi-billion deal were improved by a Financial Conduct Authority plan to create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states. This was a clear sign that London is ready to welcome Aramco and needs its IPO to attract more sovereign-held entities and prove that London remains a good place to do business after the country leaves the European Union, one of the sources said. Changes proposed by the regulator, which declined to comment, are seen as making London more attractive to state-controlled firms such as Aramco as well as other Gulf countries, including Oman and Abu Dhabi, considering listing oil assets.The FCA proposal will be reviewed until Oct. 13 and the regulator will publish new rules towards the end of the year.Aramco is less enthusiastic about listing on a third exchange, possibly one in Asia, and may prefer to stick to a dual listing process that involves Riyadh's Tadawul and London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), one of the sources said. Aramco, London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange all declined to comment, while there was no immediate comment from Saudi officials contacted by Reuters. Bankers expect to get more clarity on Aramco's listing plans at a conference organized by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) on Oct. 24 to 26 in Riyadh, one source said. Senior Saudi Aramco executives, including its chief executive, are scheduled to meet on Aug. 3 in London for a regular review of ongoing business activities, others said. A view shows Saudi Aramco's Manifa oilfield, Saudi Arabia January 22, 2015. Picture taken January 22, 2015. Saudi Aramco/Handout via REUTERSChina FactorA dual listing in London and Riyadh would be easier and faster to pursue, the sources said, adding that Aramco might miss its IPO window next year if it attempts to include a third stock market, which would add another layer of complexity. But even if Saudi Aramco is not listed in Asia, Chinese investors and companies will still be offered a sizeable stake in a bid to satisfy key buyers of Saudi crude, one source said. Reuters reported in April that China is creating a consortium, including state-owned oil giants and banks and its sovereign wealth fund, to act as a cornerstone IPO investor. Slideshow (6 Images)As well as New York and London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Toronto are all seeking to have Saudi Aramco list on their respective markets. But experts have long pointed to the amount of information public companies listed in the United States are required to disclose as a reason for a decline in IPOs in New York and Saudi Arabia will be cautious that it may be forced to reveal sensitive information relating to Aramco - which will still be largely government-owned after the IPO. This includes details on how the kingdom controls its energy sector and manages money from the company's earnings. The Saudis want to disclose as little as possible and this makes a New York listing very unattractive, one source said.But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also working on proposals to potentially scale back the scope and breadth of disclosure rules to get more companies to go public, its new chairman Jay Clayton said this month. And although Aramco's banks believe a London-listing is financially the best solution, there are other factors that the Saudis will take into account and the final outcome is far from decided, one of the sources said. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) have been hired as international financial advisers for its initial public offering, Reuters reported in March.

Adidas has shaken up its business in the United States and shed non-core businesses to regain ground lost to Nike, outpacing its rival's sales growth in key markets this year. It sold its golf business this year, striking a deal in May to sell brands TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth to private equity firm KPS Capital Partners for $425 million.

Rorsted was installed to replace long-serving former boss Herbert Hainer - who bought Reebok in 2005 - after activist shareholders took stakes in Adidas, and after several investors called on the company to sell more non-core businesses. Birch Hill will pay most of the purchase price for CCM in cash and the rest in the form of a secured note, Adidas said on Thursday. The sale will have a high double-digit million euro impact on its profit from discontinued operations in the second quarter but does not change its full-year guidance, said Adidas, which is due to publish quarterly results on Aug. 3.

Elliott, the largest Akzo investor with a 9.5 percent stake, is pursuing the case even after Akzo said on Tuesday that 70-year old Chairman Antony Burgmans would step down when his term expires next April. That will be too late for Elliott which is engaged in an increasingly bitter fight against Burgmans, who it blamed in court for financial underperformance and causing a crisis of confidence among Akzo shareholders. Akzo and Pittsburgh-based PPG are in a six-month compulsory cooling off period which expires in December. Elliott lawyer Jan-Willem de Groot said there was widespread shareholder support for their demands. Almost the entire top 20 of Akzo shareholders, representing total investments of more than 6 billion euros, have been urginga meeting for months, he said, naming British pension scheme investor USS, Franklin Templeton and Dodge & Cox. Some analysts believe the departure of the two leading opponents of a deal, after Chief Executive Ton Buechner announced his immediate resignation on July 19 due to health reasons, could open the door for talks. In a preliminary ruling in May, Amsterdam's Enterprise Chamber rejected Elliott's first bid to compel Akzo to convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to vote on dismissing Burgmans, saying it was an attempt to wrest control of the company's strategic direction from the board. Akzo said Elliott and York Capital Management, which has joined the Dutch lawsuit, were still trying to force the Dulux paintmaker to change course. All objections to Burgmans relate to the strategy and decisions regarding PPG, lawyer Harm-Jan de Kluiver said. But it's already established that Akzo Nobel's boards acted within their rights. Buechner's sudden departure left his successor, relatively new chemicals division chief Thierry Vanlancker, to deliver higher sales and margins promised when the Dutch paintmaker fended off PPG's takeover attempt. Akzo's second quarter results, announced on Tuesday, missed expectations. The company's shares traded up 1.1 percent at 76.50 euros on Thursday afternoon, far below PPG's final cash and share proposal of around 95 euros made in April. Akzo said that shareholders would have their say at an extraordinary meeting on Sept. 8, but Elliott responded furiously, saying Akzo had chosen yet again to flout fundamental shareholder rights by not allowing a vote on Burgmans too. The court will present its ruling on Aug. 10. If it rules in favor of Elliott and York, Akzo will have to convene another extraordinary shareholders meeting, as it will be too late to add items to the agenda of the Sept. 8 meeting due to regulatory deadlines.

China is Starbucks' fastest-growing market outside the United States by number of stores. The cash deal will give Starbucks ownership of about 1,300 stores in Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and aligns with its target of operating 5,000 stores in mainland China by 2021.

Impax Laboratories Inc (IPXL.O), Perrigo Company Plc (PRGO.N) and Alvogen Inc have been talking to advisers about strategic options for their generics businesses, ranging from acquisitions to increase scale to an outright sale of the units, people familiar with the matter said this week. The persons declined to speak for attribution because the discussions are private. Meanwhile, Mallinckrodt Plc (MNK.N), one of the largest producers of the generic opioid painkiller oxycodone, has been exploring a sale of its specialty generics unit, Reuters has previously reported. On an earnings call in May, the chief executive of Impax, which makes a generic version of the EpiPen allergy injection, said it was looking at deals. “We will look, of course, look for asset acquisitions on the generic side,” Paul Bisaro told analysts. “Given our size, we’re going to have to be creative.” Impax, Alvogen and Vertice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mallinckrodt and Perrigo declined to comment. Generic drugs, which are less expensive versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals, have become a key front in U.S. officials’ efforts to cut the cost of prescription drugs. U.S. consumers spend more than twice as much on drugs per capita compared with other industrialized countries, according to a 2016 report by the Journal of the American Medical Association.To bring down prices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has committed to eliminating the backlog of drug applications awaiting its approval. This could mean nearly 4,000 new medicines will come onto the market over the next several years, based on FDA estimates of drugs awaiting approval.Even before a potential flood of new products, small and mid-sized drug makers were under pressure as consolidation among generic drug distributors has made it less profitable for them to sell their drugs. Sales of generics by Impax and Perrigo dropped by 21 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier. Analysts expect continued sales declines for the rest of the year.A merger or a sale to a rival could alleviate some of the pressure through cost-cutting, reduced competition and new markets and products. It could also help companies negotiate better terms with drug distributors, such as Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N), McKesson Corp (MCK.N) and Amerisource Bergen, which control about 90 percent of all revenue from drug distribution. Getting Creative Mylan and Teva, the two largest players in the generics market by revenue, helped slow the pace of decline in their generics business last year via acquisitions. Prices dropped in the mid-single digits for both companies in 2016, according to their results, compared to over 20 percent for smaller peers such as Impax.But that scale has come at a cost. Teva’s $40 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc's (AGN.N) generic drug unit in 2016, the biggest generics deal so far, has left it with a debt load of around $35 billion. Mylan NV's (MYL.O) $7.2 billion purchase of Meda Pharmaceuticals has put its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization around 3.7, well above its target of 3. Mylan and Teva did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, private equity firms are generally hesitant to place a big bet on a sector where sales are dropping so sharply, the people familiar with the matter said.That means the companies most intent on M&A; need to get creative. “The problem is the obvious consolidators are too levered to do anything,” said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC. “What we could see instead are some mergers of equals or other transactions that could be a little bit less typical in their structure.”Perrigo, for example, has considered spinning off its generics business and merging into another generic drug maker, such as Impax Labs, the sources said, adding that it is not currently holding any talks with potential deal partners. Alvogen has assessed similar strategies, the people said, including a reverse merger for its U.S. generics business. A reverse merger involves a private company buying a public group to bypass the need to list on an exchange. Another option is to seek out less obvious buyers, particularly from overseas. Indian drug makers, such as Lupin Ltd (LUPN.NS) and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (SUN.NS), could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the U.S. generic drug makers shakeup. Their extensive pipelines of new drugs awaiting FDA approval andhealthy balance sheets could position them to comfortably acquire struggling U.S. peers, one of the people said. He declined to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. Lupin and Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Other potential buyers are Chinese firms looking for ways to move capital outside of the country, the people added. Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group Co Ltd [SPGCL.UL] recently acquired Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s Dendreon business for around $819.9 million, far more than the $300 million Valeant paid when it bought it out of bankruptcy in 2015.

The stock index provider said it made the decision based on client feedback, the latest sign of the growing importance of corporate governance rights to investors even as technology companies move to concentrate power with insiders. It plans to require new constituents of its indexes to have at least 5 percent of their voting rights in the hands of public shareholders, though current constituents will be given a five-year grace period to comply. FTSE Russell Chief Executive Mark Makepeace told Reuters in an interview many of his clients had worried that Snap's structure could set a bad precedent.There were strong opinions that voting rights are an important issue. For shareholders to perform their function they have to be able to influence a company, he said. Shareholders won't be able to hold boards accountable if they don't have voting rights, Makepeace said.He added that some clients may now push for an even higher minimum voting standard, though he does not expect an adjustment before the plans become effective in September. We may hear views asking for a higher minimum, but I think this represents a very strong first step and I think it's a prudent way forward that recognizes the issues investors are raising, he said. A Snap representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Inclusion in a stock index has been an important milestone for young companies, bringing their shares into many passive funds and others that closely follow indexes like the S&P; 500, a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide. The FTSE Russell decision now means that funds like the $19 billion iShares Russell 1000 ETF would not hold Snap and, potentially, other companies already in the index that have less than 5 percent of voting rights in public hands unless they make changes. FTSE Russell said that set could include companies like Match Group (MTCH.O), owner of dating app Match.com, and software maker Mulesoft (MULE.N). A representative for Match Group did not respond to a request for comment, and a Mulesoft spokeswoman declined to comment.How index providers should treat companies with unequal voting rights has been a hot topic for technology investors after Snap disclosed its unprecedented corporate structure ahead of its $3.4 billion initial public offering in March. Big investment firms like BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N) have stressed their attention to shareholder rights lately. That could put those firms on a collision course with Silicon Valley companies keen on keeping decision-making power in the hands of founders and other insiders - although to be sure many big fund managers went ahead and bought Snap despite its structure. The Council of Institutional Investors, whose members include big pension funds critical of Snap's structure, praised FTSE Russell's decision and said it could put pressure on other index providers to take similar steps. FTSE Russell's decision is a rebuke to companies that would deny public shareholders any voice in company matters, said the group's executive director, Ken Bertsch, in an e-mailed statement. Snap surged in early trading following its market debut but since then has collapsed to 21 percent below its IPO price. Investorsworry about competition from Facebook and the looming expiries of insider- and employee-trading restrictions that could lead to a flood of shares on the market.

Chinese firms should exercise prudent decision making regarding overseas investments in real estate, hotels, film studios, entertainment and sports clubs, a spokesman for the country's Ministry of Commerce said at a briefing. We will continue to work with relevant departments to guard against risks of outbound investment, and ensure the healthy and orderly development of investment overseas, ministry spokesman Gao Feng said, according to a transcript of the event. Gao was responding to a question about real estate giant Dalian Wanda Group, which has recently come under the spotlight over its overseas deals in entertainment and film.Wanda has been very active globally, with deals for U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Hollywood film studio Legendary Entertainment, Odeon & UCI Cinemas and Nordic Cinema Group, as well as a UK luxury yacht maker. It also owns a stake in soccer club Atletico Madrid. China will support companies investing overseas according to market and international rules, especially in 'Belt and Road' developments, Gao said, referring to China's push to increase infrastructure investment along a modern day 'Silk Road'. Beijing's crackdown on showy overseas ventures and high-profile empire builders has drawn in several corporations apart from Wanda, such as HNA Group, Anbang Insurance, Fosun International and Zhejiang Luosen that was behind the purchase of A.C.

Fresh funds for the firm, which has been hurt by its late entry into organic light-emitting diode screens (OLED) and fluctuating demand for Apple's iPhones, would come on top of 75 billion yen in aid late last year from its main investor - the state-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ). The liquid crystal display manufacturer has tapped Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, the source said, adding that the creditors were willing to extend the loan if it was guaranteed by INCJ. The source declined to be identified as talks on the matter were private. Officials at Mizuho, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and INCJ declined to comment while a representative for SMBC was not immediately available for comment. The request was first reported by the Nikkei business daily. It said INCJ would provide the guarantees and that further restructuring may involve halting production at its smartphone panel plants in the central Japanese city of Nomi and China's Jiangsu Province as well as cutting several hundred jobs through an early retirement offer. Japan Display said in a statement it was looking at implementing drastic steps to reshape itself amid shifting market conditions. We will make an announcement when we reach a decision, it said. INCJ helped form Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp five years ago, but government intervention has so far failed to result in putting the firm on a solid business. Apple is widely tipped to adopt OLED displays, which are thinner and more flexible than LCD screens, for its iPhone 8 expected in the second half of 2017, and Japan Display's lack of a presence in that segment of the market has put it at a major disadvantage.

Hong Kong-based Noble added that it would explore strategic alliances in Asia with Mercuria after establishing some initial links with the Swiss trader's Asian affiliates. Noble announced on Wednesday the plans to sell its U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for $248 million and has also put its capital-intensive oil liquids business up for sale, leaving it focused on hard commodities, essentially coal. Singapore-listed Noble has struggled to repair investor confidence following setbacks over the past two years: first blogger Iceberg Research questioned its accounts in early 2015, and then it was hit by a sharp commodity market downturn. The company has stood by its accounts. But the upheaval meant a collapsing share price, credit downgrades, management changes and asset sales. Noble's market value has shrunk to $554 million, from $6 billion in February 2015. Wednesday's announcement marks Noble's latest move to restructure to help it repay debt and keep trading. It also announced an up-to-$1 billion disposal plan for assets outside North America over the next two years. Sources close to the transaction said the initial links in Asia would see Mercuria market some of Noble's hard commodities, mainly its coal book. Mercuria has been trying to expand its Asian business, particularly in China. ChemChina bought a 12 percent stake in the trading house last year.It certainly spreads the risk of operating these businesses, so from that perspective it should be welcome, Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at Religare Capital Markets, said. Related CoverageNoble Group shares halve after profit warning, asset salesNeeding Cash Noble has been seeking a cash injection for months and said on Wednesday it would continue to look for a new investor, as well as alliances to help to fund its working capital. The purchase appears a good fit for Mercuria, whose chief executive, Marco Dunand, said last year it was looking to expand further in natural gas in North America after buying a large gas portfolio through its purchase of JP Morgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) physical trading arm in 2014. The deal could move Mercuria into the top 10 gas players in the United States up from number 14, according to 2016 data from U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Mercuria traded 1,720.6 trillion Btu in 2016. It is also looking to acquire physical assets in Louisiana, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Noble, tackling $3.3 billion of debt, said the need to scale back risk and conserve cash contributed to its second-quarter loss, which it estimated at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, as it was not able to seize trading opportunities. The net loss also includes the impact of writedowns on its portfolio - it announced $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of exceptional items. It could be the case that a prospective investor would view the balance sheet more favourably as a result of those writedowns, Religare's Tiruchelvam said. Noble said it expected further strain in the commodities trading industry as players grapple with low margins and lenders seek to reduce exposure. The group said it was positioning itself for continuing stress in the sector, which the board believes is likely to lead to industry consolidation. Realistic Noble has battled to retain staff, offering cash bonuses for top performers. But on Wednesday it said it would cut its staff to 400 from about 900. Chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist appointed earlier this year, said the latest overhaul offered a realistic prospect of dealing with the group's liabilities. The group further believes that its creditors and shareholders now have a clearer view of its direction and plans to address its challenges, he said. Richard Elman, who founded the company in 1986, took advantage of a commodities bull run to build Noble into one of the world's biggest traders. But in the last two years Elman, 77, had sought to steer Noble back its roots as an asset-light trading house. Elman stepped down as chairman this year but remains the company's biggest shareholder, with a stake of just over 18 percent. Other top shareholders include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and Orbis Investment Management, according to Thomson Reuters data. Noble said negotiations with its lenders were continuing. Last month, the company was granted a four-month extension by lenders on a key credit deadline, giving Noble until October.

(Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Wednesday gave Elliott Management Corp 11 more days to formalize its plans to bid on Oncor Electric Delivery Co before the court approves the $9 billion offer for the utility from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Judge Christopher Sontchi of the Delaware bankruptcy court pushed back the hearing for the approval of Berkshire's merger agreement with Oncor, which carries a $270 million termination fee should it fall through, to Aug. 21 from Aug. 10.Elliott, the largest creditor of Oncor's bankrupt parent Energy Future Holdings Corp, said it needed more time to finalize the financing for its $9.3 billion offer, after securing about $1.4 billion in new equity for its bid so far. It had asked for a delay of 35 to 40 days. If billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire has not won court approval of its offer from the bankruptcy court by Aug. 21, it will walk away from the deal, Patrick Goodman, the chief financial officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, told Sontchi.Berkshire's all-cash bid already has regulators' support and promises to pull Oncor, the largest utility in Texas, out of its more than three-year bankruptcy. Regulatory hurdles scuttled two earlier deals for Oncor. Roger Wood, a Moelis & Co investment banker representing Elliott, told the court that 10 other investors had expressed interest in joining Elliott in its bid. If all of them put in the amount they had indicated, Elliott would raise between $9.7 billion and $11.85 billion, he said.FILE PHOTO: Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management Corporation, speaks at WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 25, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoWe would be oversubscribed, Wood said. Some $3.7 billion of that investment interest came from a single investor in the form of proposed debt financing, Wood added. Chad Husnick, an attorney for Energy Future, warned earlier that if the court does not approve Berkshire's deal on Aug. 21, and Elliott subsequently fails in its attempt to acquire Oncor, Berkshire may return but at a lower price. Elliott's offer values Oncor at $18.5 billion including debt, above Berkshire's current $18.1 billion valuation. Even if Berkshire's deal for Oncor closes, Energy Future may still face an uphill battle winning Sontchi's approval for its Chapter 11 reorganization plan. This is because Elliott, which owns more than two-thirds of a key piece of Energy Future's unsecured debt, anticipates voting against the plan, people familiar with the matter said.Sontchi could also be swayed by other creditors who favor a deal with Berkshire, which has said it can serve as a stable, long-term owner for Oncor.

Scripps shares ended trading on Wednesday at $84.07. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Viacom, Scripps and Discovery declined to comment. Cable TV networks are coming under pressure as more viewers watch their favorite shows and movies on their phones and tablets, and there is also increasing competition for viewers from streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. By adding Scripps programming, Discovery, which has a market capitalization of $15.2 billion, could launch its own skinny bundle of networks at a low cost for viewers. The deal would also help Discover to sell its content overseas more easily.

HNA still awaits U.S. government approval for another deal, agreed in January, to buy a majority stake in hedge fund investment firm SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, U.S. President Donald Trump's new communications director.Global Eagle said in a securities filing late Tuesday that the deal was canceled because the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had not completed its national security review by a so-called outside date agreed in its deal with HNA. Global Eagle's share price closed down 11 percent at $2.98 on Nasdaq. Global Eagle and HNA did not elaborate on the reasons for the regulatory rejection, but a source familiar with the matter said that the protection of customer data passed on through Global Eagle's WiFi service was a major area of concern for CFIUS. Anytime you do anything with a communication system, there's always additional caution, said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who followed the deal but was not involved in it.CFIUS, which assesses international acquisitions for potential national security risks, has objected to a historically high number of deals this year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. The more conservative stance under U.S. President Donald Trump coincides with growing political and economic tension between the United States and China. At the same time, China's government is increasingly scrutinizing banking relationships and aggressive overseas deal-making of some large conglomerates as it looks to stem the flow of capital leaving the country. National Security Concerns HNA unit Beijing Shareco Technologies Co Ltd agreed to buy up to 34.9 percent of Global Eagle in November, which would have made it the single largest shareholder of the provider of satellite-based connectivity and media to sectors including aviation, maritime and home entertainment. In April, Global Eagle Chief Executive Jeffrey Leddy said CFIUS had found unresolved national security concerns and that a new application would explore mitigation alternatives. Global Eagle declined to comment on the deal's cancellation and CFIUS did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Beijing Shareco did not respond to Reuters' queries. HNA declined to comment. Chinese firms in recent years have been scouting for U.S. targets as varied as hotels and film studios, to expand in the country and hedge against a weaker home currency. They have announced 87 deals this year in the United States, a record high and up from 77 in the corresponding period of 2016. But with CFIUS becoming more conservative, deals success is less certain. Deals that collapsed while under review include U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp's (INSG.O) sale of its MiFi mobile hotspot unit to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries. Chinese deals awaiting approval include Ant Financial's $1.2 billion purchase of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) and China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's [OWREAC.UL] $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N). Both deals also involve personal data of customers that has to be protected. China OpportunitiesAs China cracks down on showy overseas ventures and high-profile empire builders, pressure is rising on sprawling, fast-growing and acquisitive companies such as HNA, which has announced $50 billion of deals over two years, buying stakes in logistics companies, hotels and even Deutsche Bank Group AG (DBKGn.DE). HNA disclosed an ownership change this week, after two major shareholders, Bharat Bhise, CEO of Bravia Capital, and Guan Jun, a Beijing businessman, who owned 17.4 percent and 12.35 percent of the company respectively, transferred their shares to a New York-based charitable foundation. HNA said the change was aimed at advancing its philanthropic mission and maximising efforts in corporate social responsibility.On Monday, HNA also brushed off concerns that some Wall Street banks were shying away from its business, and said it maintained a strong working relationship with key banks including JPMorgan (JPM.N), UBS (UBSG.S) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). The investment agreement with Global Eagle also involved establishing a Chinese joint venture providing Chinese airlines with in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) services, in which the HNA unit was to hold a controlling stake. Global Eagle said it continued to operate under existing agreements to provide other equipment and services to HNA-affiliated carriers Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd (600221.SS), Beijing Capital Airlines Holding Co Ltd and Yangtze River Airlines Co Ltd.

The report by the Brazilian newspaper did not cite how it obtained the information. JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, purchased a controlling stake in Pilgrim's Pride in 2009 for $2.8 billion, backed by a $2 billion loan from state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL]. JBS is now rushing to sell assets and raise cash in order to help its holding company, J&F; Investimentos SA, pay a big fine after becoming embroiled in sweeping graft probes that ensnared Brazilian politicians and executives. JBS said last month that its majority stake in Pilgrim's Pride is not for sale because it was critical to its long-term strategy of pursuing business opportunities that reduce volatility and enhance margins. JBS shares climbed about 7 percent to 7.47 reais, lifted in part by news late on Tuesday that the company reached a deal with banks to stabilize terms of debt owed by its JBS Brasil unit. In New York, Pilgrim shares closed up 2.1 percent to $24.00. Vertical Group analyst Heather Jones reiterated a recommendation to buy Pilgrim's shares, with a base target price of $33 per share. We view reports of Cargill's interest as credible given its M&A; activity in global poultry in recent years, Jones said in a note. JBS's willingness to sell is another matter.

The move by Viacom, which had $12.17 billion in debt as of March 31, could potentially mean that the $14.3 billion media company would lose its investment-grade status to buy the $10.6 billion Scripps. Last year Moody's downgraded Viacom's debt to the lowest level of investment grade - a status they would likely lose as a result of the deal. Viacom is bidding for Scripps, which owns channels such as HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel, against Discovery Communications, which is not expected to make an all-cash bid, according to the sources, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. A Viacom spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a Discovery spokesman. It is not clear what the bids were valued at or whether Viacom or Discovery has won the bidding for Scripps, but a decision was expected within the next few days, according to the sources.It is also possible that a deal may not happen. FILE PHOTO: A woman exits the Viacom Inc. headquarters in New York, U.S. on April 30, 2013.Lucas Jackson/File PhotoMaking an all-cash bid would mark an aggressive move for Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish, who has pledged to turn around the struggling media company, which owns MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures. A deal with Scripps would create a $24.9 billion cable network that brings together non-scripted programming and scripted programming, including children's shows and a movie studio. Bakish was named to his role late last year after discussions between CBS Corp and Viacom about a possible recombination ended. Viacom has spent the past months focusing resources on six of its brands, including the soon-to-be-launched Paramount Network. New York-based Viacom also has been selling assets, including its stake in premium channel Epix to MGM Holdings Inc, in order to reduce debt. By acquiring Scripps, Viacom can gain cost savings and scale. Larger programmers are thought to have more leverage in negotiations with cable and satellite providers to carry their shows.There also is increasing competition for viewers from streaming services like Netflix Inc and Amazon. Viacom has been talking to cable and satellite companies about launching a so-called skinny bundle of non-sports networks for less than $20 per month. By acquiring Scripps programming, Viacom has more to offer its pay TV partners for such a bundle.

Some investors have also indicated they would prefer a stronger focus at Deutsche's asset management arm on so-called passive investments or exchange traded funds (ETFs), whereas its main business is currently with actively managed funds.The IPO story is not ready yet, one of the people said, adding that in his view the unit needed to invest in its ETF business to keep up with competitors. A spokesperson for Deutsche (DBKGn.DE) said: We are currently focused on creating a Deutsche AM business that is distinct from Deutsche Bank, in preparation for the planned partial IPO. We expect to complete that process later this year. We have not yet started to present our equity story to investors. Deutsche Bank reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Chief Executive John Cryan conceded in May it would take time to realize the benefits of the lender's latest efforts to plant and sow - or breathe new life into the Deutsche brand.ETFs Deutsche Asset Management currently has 723 billion euros invested worldwide, of which 540 billion are actively managed, 103 billion in ETFs and the rest in alternatives such as real estate. Concern around the scale of Deutsche's ETF offering comes as market leaders BlackRock (BLK.N) and Vanguard continue to grow assets under management in Europe, with the latter flagging plans to expand its continental operations. Underpinning that is a belief the market for ETFs in Europe will continue to grow strongly over the coming years, fuelled in part by new regulations aimed at making the costs of investing more transparent.European ETF assets rose for the fifth straight year to hit a record 514.5 billion euros in 2016, data from Thomson Reuters Lipper show, up 15 percent but still just a fraction of the 9.4 trillion euros in total invested assets. But with asset managers under pressure from investors to cut fees, even in the already low-cost ETF market, a provider needs to have scale to succeed. European sales of ETFs during 2016 were led by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, the Lipper data show, with Deutsche Bank not even making the top-10.It still retained its position as the second-biggest ETF provider in Europe, behind BlackRock's iShares, with assets under management of 53.3 billion euros, the data show. But by May, Deutsche's ETF brand Xtrackers had fallen to third place behind BlackRock and Societe Generale's Lyxor unit. [tmsnrt.rs/2uwBywT] An analyst at a top-50 shareholder in Deutsche Bank was more sanguine about the company's ETF market position, with a number six position globally leaving it probably at minimum efficient scale, but with clearly scope to build in the United States.Deutsche Bank is, however, making headway with the organizational work for listing the asset management division.Division head Nicolas Moreau said last month the bundling of the unit's businesses into one holding company would be done by October, as would the finalization of distribution and service contracts between Deutsch asset management and its mothership.Investment banks vying for mandates to help organize the listing had expected Deutsche to pick a so-called global coordinator - which will work alongside Deutsche's own investment bank on the deal - before the summer break.That has slipped into the second half of the year, people close to the matter said, adding banks that helped Deutsche with its 8.5 billion euro capital raising earlier this year stood a good chance of securing roles on the deal. Deutsche hopes that by giving its asset management arm more operational independence the unit will attract more talent, and Cryan has said the bank will maintain a controlling and super-majority stake in the business.

The talks are more advanced than previously thought, the sources said.With earnings from Thyssenkrupp's industrials businesses sound and those at the steel unit weak due to structural overcapacity in the sector, Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger is facing pressure from investors to deliver the merger. The fiscal year will come to an end soon (in September) and Hiesinger wants to have a story for investors. If it would not come to a merger it would be a severe defeat for (him), a German union source said. Hiesinger has staked his reputation on transforming Thyssenkrupp from a loss-making steelmaker into a diversified industrials group, with steel now contributing just under a quarter of the firm's revenues. His ultimate aim is for Thyssenkrupp to exit the steel business altogether.He (Hiesinger) has invested too much time for it to now fail, a banking source familiar with the matter said. The biggest stumbling block in talks to merge the two firms' European steel assets was largely resolved in May, when Tata said it had agreed the main terms of a deal with the British regulator to cut benefits for its 15 billion pound ($19.40 billion) UK pension scheme. With Thyssenkrupp said to be satisfied with the preliminary deal and German unions acknowledging behind the scenes that they cannot stop the merger, sources said the long-running talks should be formalized in the next couple of months.One source familiar with the matter said much still hinged on final clearance from the regulator for the Tata pensions deal and that both sides were unlikely to make any announcement before then. A pensions source, however, said regulatory clearance was pending. I would be surprised if it (clearance) didn't happen by September, he said. Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. With both companies having suffered heavy losses in steel in recent years, they are intent on a merger that would bring capacity cuts, consolidation, pricing power and synergy savings. While German unions are publicly against the venture, they privately acknowledge they cannot stop a deal even if all 10 union representatives on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board vote against it. They are concerned, however, that Thyssenkrupp is looking to take on a minority stake in the joint venture and is keen on handing over day to day management to Tata. Unions fear any future job cuts would fall disproportionately on them versus legacy Tata staff.It could take three to four years to integrate the two operations and deliver the sort of savings - 500 million euros a year by some estimates - that could help pave the way for an initial public offering that would see Thyssenkrupp finally exit the steel sector. The Tata pensions deal alone could take until early next year to implement even though it is due to be cleared shortly, pensions sources say.However, Martin Hunter, principal at consultants Punter Southall, said that to avoid delay, Tata and Thyssenkrupp could announce the deal but make a final tie-up contingent on the end shape of the Tata pension deal.

The threat raises the stakes in a standoff over the shipyard's fate, the only one in France with facilities large enough to build aircraft carriers. Fincantieri agreed in May to pay 79.5 million euros ($92.6 million) for two-thirds of STX France, which is being sold following the collapse of South Korean parent STX, but the Italian bid has raised fears for French jobs at the Saint-Nazaire site on the Atlantic Coast. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said nationalization would give the state more time to find a better shareholder deal, but even if temporary, it would mark the first major state intervention in the corporate world by Macron's government, which was elected on a pro-business platform. Italian interests rejected the French proposal for ownership of STX France to be split equally between Italian state-owned shipbuilder Fincantieri (FCT.MI) and Paris. Both Fincantieri Chief Executive Giuseppe Bono and Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda raised the prospect that Fincantieri could walk away from the deal if France backed away from conditions agreed under the former government of President Francois Hollande, who left office in May. We are Europeans and on STX we cannot accept being treated worse than the Koreans, Bono said on a conference call in reference to the shipyard's previous majority owner. Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan later took a more conciliatory tone, saying Italy was open to changing the terms of the deal, but insisted Fincantieri must have control. We have offered to listen to the new government's requirements, but there is no reason why Fincantieri should give up a majority stake and control of the French company. Unions Divided Trade unions are split over the nationalization option, with the hardline Force Ouvriere in favor but others against. FILE PHOTO: French Economy minister Bruno Le Maire takes a picture of French President Emmanuel Macron (not pictured) near the MSC Meraviglia cruise ship during a visit to the STX Les Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard site in Saint-Nazaire, France, May 31, 2017.Stephane Mahe/File PhotoSome people here will be glad about nationalization but that's not what will bring us work. Our clients need certainty, said Christophe Morel, representative of the CFDT, France's biggest trade union. Le Maire said Fincantieri was welcome to invest in STX but on an equal footing with French partners and said that the Italians had until Thursday to make up their minds about the offer on the table. If our Italian friends say 'this deal does not work for us, we don't agree with 50/50', the state will exercise its pre-emption rights on STX, Le Maire told franceinfo radio. We will buy shares, we are majority owners and we will give ourselves time to negotiate a new shareholder pact. Under an existing pact, the French state has a pre-emption right to buy out shareholders that runs until the end of the month. Le Maire said the cost of buying out STX's other shareholders was on a scale of tens of millions of euros rather than in the billions of euros. Fincantieri's shares closed down 8.7 percent at 0.959 euros a share following the STX France news and after it published first-half earnings. Macron was elected in May on promises to boost growth by lifting constraints on business and his government has since flagged plans to privatize non-strategic state holdings while easing labor regulations. However, it has also not hesitated to lean on carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen, in which the state owns stakes, to help a struggling parts maker in a region where jobs are scarce. Macron decided after his election to review the terms of Fincantieri's deal to acquire the STX France stake. We are not happy with the deal negotiated by the previous government because it does not allow French shareholders to keep control of jobs, industrial capacities and regional development, Le Maire said. The French side has been concerned the Italians would shift projects from Saint-Nazaire to Italy as the shipyard's order book for huge luxury ocean liners is currently brimming over. But the French also have a strategic interest in the shipyard for its capacity to build warships. Le Maire offered to extend naval construction cooperation as part of a 50/50 ownership deal.

The board of Jasper Infotech, which runs Snapdeal, approved Flipkart's (IPO-FLPK.N) bid of $900 million-$950 million last week, the sources who were familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the talks are private.Two other sources said, however, that obstacles still remain and that the deal will need approval from smaller shareholders of Snapdeal before it gets finalized.The shares-swap deal would help SoftBank Group (9984.T), Snapdeal's biggest investor, gain a stake in Flipkart, the leading homegrown player, at a time when Indian e-commerce is booming. Helped by a spurt in availability of cheap phones and data plans, more and more Indians are shopping on the web. A 2016 report from accounting firm EY said that e-commerce had grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 50 percent in the last five years in India and the pace of growth is expected to continue, with e-commerce sales topping $35 billion by 2020. The rapid growth has been accompanied by severe competition and a fierce war for supremacy between Flipkart and U.S. online retail giant Amazon, which has committed to investing $5 billion in the country. The acquisition of Snapdeal means one less rival for Flipkart, said Harminder Sahni the founder of Wazir Advisors, a boutique consultancy firm. Flipkart may have a plan to run Snapdeal as a differently positioned business just like they run Myntra and Jabong, he said. Myntra and Jabong are Flipkart's fashion portals.

Axis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources said Snapdeal's founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal still have reservations about an acquisition by Flipkart however, and are mulling an alternate path. Bahl and Bansal want to use the money from the sale of Snapdeal's logistics arm Vulcan Express and FreeCharge to run a downsized marketplace, they said.

Ceconomy said on Wednesday it had signed a deal to buy a 24.33 percent stake in Fnac Darty from Artemis, a French holding company owned by businessman Francois Henri Pinault, for around 452 million euros ($526 million) in cash, or 70 euros a share. Pieter Haas, Ceconomy's chief executive, said the investment allowed the company to gain exposure to the highly attractive French market and its particularly strong consumer electronics segment. France is one of the few major European markets where Ceconomy, which runs stores under the Media Markt and Saturn brands, has no presence.Fnac shares were up 4.7 percent at 79.08 euros by 1055 GMT as some analysts speculated Ceconomy might eventually buy the rest of the French company. Ceconomy's shares were 8.4 percent higher at 10 euros. This deal clearly indicates that Ceconomy plans more exposure in this market and intends to be the consolidator of the continental European electronics market, Raymond James analysts said in a note, reiterating a strong buy rating on Ceconomy shares. After a six-month lock-up, starting mid-July 2017, Ceconomy will be able to dispose of a 9 percent stake in Metro WFS (the rest of Metro). The market is more than likely to believe that Ceconomy will try to acquire further control when financial resources are freed up, and we believe that Fnac Darty has become more obvious prey as of today's transaction, they added. A spokeswoman for Ceconomy said it was comfortable with a 24 percent stake at present.Fnac Darty has more than 660 stores and with sales of over 7 billion euros is France's biggest consumer electronics retailer with a market share of 23 percent, Ceconomy said.The move comes just a week after former Fnac Darty CEO Alexandre Bompard, who led Fnac's recovery, left the company to take the top seat at French retailer Carrefour (CARR.PA). Bompard, who was brought in by the Pinault family, had led Fnac since January 2011. Fnac shares have nearly tripled in value since its stock market listing in 2013. Artemis's other assets range from luxury group Kering (PRTP.PA) to auction house Christie's and Bordeaux wine Chateau Latour. Ceconomy is Europe's biggest consumer electronics group, ahead of Britain's Dixons Carphone (DC.L), running more than 1,000 stores in 15 European countries and with sales of 22 billion euros in the 2015/16 financial year. The deal for Artemis' entire stake in Fnac Darty should be completed by the end of August and Ceconomy expects to retain its investment grade credit rating, it said.Metro split into two separate companies - Ceconomy and its food business - earlier this month and at the time said Ceconomy would drive consolidation in Europe. The purchase price may change should Metro or one of its units make a public takeover offer for Fnac Darty within two years.

In a statement, Celgene said it has agreed to resolve a whistleblower lawsuit that alleged it had violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false claims to Medicare. The company has denied any wrongdoing in this matter, but said it was settling to avoid the uncertainty, distraction, and expense of protracted litigation. The lawsuit alleged that Celgene violated the laws of 28 states and the District of Columbia by submitting fraudulent claims to state healthcare programs, including California's Medi-Cal program. The DoJ said Celgene was expected to pay the settlement on Wednesday. On March 1, Reuters reported that Celgene and the whistleblower, Beverly Brown, had asked the judge presiding over the case not to issue any substantive rulings for 30 days while they pursue mediation. Brown, a former sales representative for the company, sued New Jersey-based Celgene in 2010, bringing claims on behalf of the federal government and about two dozen states, including California, Illinois, Texas and New Jersey. The case was unsealed in 2014. Brown claimed that Celgene engaged in the off-label marketing of its drugs, which caused off-label prescriptions that were ineligible for reimbursement to be submitted to Medicare and state Medicaid programs, violating the federal False Claims Act. Thalomid was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1998 to treat a rare skin disease related to leprosy. The drug's active chemical, thalidomide, was known for causing birth defects when it was used to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and 1960s.Celegene's flagship drug Revlimid, approved in 2005, is a chemical derivative of thalidomide. Both drugs are now approved for use in some cancer patients. Brown said in her lawsuit that Celgene promoted the drugs as cancer treatments for which they were not approved. The promotional efforts included kickbacks paid to doctors to speak about the drugs, her complaint said.

The stake, which is worth as much as $4.5 billion and held in a fund belonging to Macquarie's infrastructure business, will be put up for sale later this year, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is private. The timetable for the sale is dependent on Puget's discussions with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission about the electric and gas prices the utility will charge going forward. Puget has applied to increase prices to fund upgrades to its infrastructure and other expenses, while the regulator recommended in June that Puget cut charges based on readjusting the value of a coal plant and costs relating to storm damages. A decision, on what is known as a general rate case, is due by mid-December. Macquarie and Moelis declined to comment. Infrastructure businesses, such as utilities, have been highly prized in recent years by investors due to their steady, long-term revenue generation. Avista Corp, another Washington-based electric utility, said last week it had agreed to be sold to Canada's Hydro One [HYDRO.UL] for $5.3 billion including debt, while Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management are currently competing to acquire Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co [TXEFHO.UL] for around $18 billion. Macquarie was part of a consortium including three Canadian pension funds that bought Puget in 2009 for $7.4 billion. Bloomberg News reported in June that Macquarie was considering selling Puget, whose core business - Puget Sound Energy - is a regulated utility serving 1.1 million electric and 790,000 natural gas customers, primarily in Western Washington state.

Japanese trading companies, global pension funds and buyout firms are also in the fray to buy Singapore-based Equis, the sources said, at a time when many Asian governments are expanding the use of renewable power and its costs are falling. First-round bids for Equis are due this week, said the sources. Equis owns a portfolio of 97 projects comprising solar, wind and hydro generation assets spread across countries including Japan, India, Philippines and Australia. What this offers is a great platform for somebody who wants to have a pan-Asia view of the renewable energy sector and a good story because it has got revenue generating assets as well as assets which will give upside, said Sharad Somani, KPMG's Asia-Pacific head of power and utilities. Equis is owned by Equis Funds Group, which has raised $2.7 billion from global investors for infrastructure investments, mostly in renewables, over the past five years. Equis Funds was set up by a group of senior executives, many of whom worked at Australian investment bank Macquarie Group. Bidders are forming consortiums so that they can divide the portfolio as some buyers are keen to only buy certain assets, the sources said. Some of the sources said Equis is looking to put a full value on its projects with an asking price of $4 billion to $5 billion but some buyers are keen to only pay for the actual assets that Equis has currently. Equis has a 4.4 gigawatt portfolio of operating projects, with an additional 6.7 gigawatt under development. My sense is that a strategic investor can value the upsides of potential new projects coming in the next three to five years much better than a pure financial investor, said KPMG's Somani. Other potential suitors include French utility Engie (ENGIE.PA), a combined bid by Japanese financial conglomerate Orix Corp (8591.T) and Dutch pension fund APG, and a joint bid from infrastructure investor I Squared Capital and a Japanese trading company, the sources said, adding that some Southeast Asian groups are also keen to join the consortiums. Shell, SoftBank, Orix and Equis declined to comment, while Engie, I Squared and APG did not immediately respond to Reuters queries. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. One banker said Japanese assets, which formed the bulk of the value of Equis' portfolio, are key to the success of any consortium, adding that a winning group would require a big pension fund or a similar long term fund as a partner. Equis said in April it had appointed Credit Suisse and JPMorgan as financial advisers for a strategic review of its renewable energy portfolio. The firm had considered a Singapore IPO last year but then decided on a trade sale, sources said.

With 70-year old Chairman Antony Burgmans leaving when his term expires, Akzo will have lost the two men who led the resistance to a deal with PPG following the resignation of Chief Executive Ton Buechner last week on health grounds. Adding to the pressure on Akzo, its second quarter profit fell short of expectations on Tuesday, while the company dismissed demands made by major shareholder Elliott Advisors for a vote on the immediate ousting of Burgmans. Akzo and PPG are in a six-month cooling off period which is set to expire in December and analysts said a possible deal could be rekindled as new management beds in. The question now is whether Akzo's board will stay unanimous in its resistance of PPG, analyst Joost van Beek of Theodoor Gilissen said. The PPG story is not completely over, they will wait and see if new chances arise. Akzo shares traded 0.2 percent higher at 75.42 euros by 1500 GMT, having lost more than 2 percent earlier in the day. They remain well short of a figure of around 95 euros offered in PPG's final cash and share proposal in April. Akzo said that shareholders would have their say at an extraordinary meeting on Sept. 8 but with votes limited to the appointment of new Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker. Shareholders cannot add items to the agenda because the minimum 60-day term for requests has already expired. That failed to placate Elliott which wants a vote to try to force out Burgmans. Elliott said that Akzo has chosen yet again to flout fundamental shareholder rights, by not giving investors the opportunity to add items to the agenda. Akzo spokesman Andrew Wood said the meeting was scheduled as early as it could have been and many shareholders had asked for a vote on the CEO as soon as possible.

Akzo also said it had appointed JPMorgan Cazenove asadvisor for shareholder relations after a court in May ordered it to mend fences with investors. In another effort to reassure shareholders, Akzo said executive pay would be more closely linked to hitting financial targets. At the Sept. 8 shareholder meeting Akzo will provide further explanations about its refusal of a deal with Pittsburgh-based PPG. The maker of Dulux paints will at a later moment also seek approval for the proposed spin off of the special chemical business, a central plank in the company's strategy. Akzo on Tuesday said its core profit in the second quarter fell 6 percent to 461 million euros, due to weak demand in various markets and higher raw material costs.

One of the reasons for falling demand for Kors bags was the fact that the company was expanding too fast, which made the brand too ubiquitous.

Kors will pay a premium of 36.5 percent to Jimmy Choo's closing price before it was put up for sale. Slideshow (2 Images)Multi-Brand Strategy Berenberg analyst Zuzanna Pusz said the Kors and Coach deals showed U.S. accessible luxury companies were pursuing the multi-brand strategy found in Europe, where cash flows from one large brand are reinvested into smaller but faster growing ones. Pusz said it was probably a sensible move in the long term, with competition unlikely to wane anytime soon.Companies such as Kering SA (PRTP.PA) have implemented the multi-brand strategy to boost revenue. Kering houses brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo put itself up for sale in April after its majority-owner JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family, signaled its intention to focus on consumer goods instead. Jimmy Choo will continue to be led by the same management team, including Creative Director Sandra Choi who joined the company at its inception. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan acted for Michael Kors on the deal, while Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Liberum and RBC Europe acted for Jimmy Choo.

Sybenetix will enable the exchange group to expand its current market surveillance technology offering to service buy-side firms, Nasdaq said on Tuesday. It did not disclose the amount it intends to pay, but said the purchase price would be funded with cash on hand. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman has been vocal about investing more in innovative technologies such as cognitive computing. This deal is Nasdaq's first acquisition since her appointment in January. Other than running stock exchanges, Nasdaq has a large division that sells market technology to trading firms, exchanges and clearing houses around the world.It runs a leading market surveillance software businesses, which includes a product called Smarts that helps brokers, exchanges and regulators identify potentially abusive trading across a range of markets. More than 45 marketplaces, 17 regulators and 140 market participants use its surveillance tools. Our primary goal with this is our entry into the buy-side market with a compliance solution, Valerie Bannert-Thurner, senior vice president and head of risk & surveillance solutions at Nasdaq, said in an interview. We talk to firms globally who are looking at how they can beef up their surveillance and improve their compliance. The acquisition will also enable Nasdaq to develop solutions that analyze data beyond trading records to better spot conduct risk, Bannert-Thurner said.Sybenetix was founded in 2011. Its technology uses advanced analytics and behavioral science to help buy-side firms such as hedge funds spot patterns for compliance purposes, but can also be used to enhance their performance.Investors have been growing more interested in the sector known as regtech: companies offering technology that helps banks and investors cope with an array of post-financial crisis regulations in order to avoid hefty fines. Regtech startups such as Sybenetix take advantage of technology to automate the analysis of vast amounts of data, helping financial firms improve the effectiveness of their compliance operations at lower costs.

Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, also wants to buy the business. It sought an injunction to block the sale to the consortium, arguing that any transaction required its consent. The legal battle has unnerved the state-backed funds and they want the deal to be conditional on the conflict with Western Digital being resolved. Another key point of contention has been a proposal by SK Hynix to help fund the deal with convertible bonds - a step that could eventually give it an equity interest in the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Japanese government officials are eager to keep Toshiba's semiconductor technology in domestic hands, according to sources. In attempt to revive the stalled talks, Toshiba earlier this month began reconsidering offers from Western Digital and Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), sources have said. Western Digital is also offering about 2 trillion yen and would form an alliance with U.S. private equity firm join KKR & Co (KKR.N) as well as the two Japanese government funds that are part of the preferred bidder group, the source said on Tuesday.

However, campaigns to spur company sales could put activists at odds with some large and powerful investors and undermine their recent efforts to project the image of long-term value creators rather than quick-buck artists.U.S. activist campaigns that called for companies to explore some type of sale process totaled 91 so far this year, more than double the number a year ago, Thomson Reuters data show. The data excludes companies worth $300 million or less.For activists, the demands are increasingly turning into deals.The number of activist investments that ended with a company sale jumped from seven in 2010 to 25 four years later and 36 last year, according to research and data provider Activist Insight.Most small to mid-cap companies eventually get bought. That's the way the world works. There's nothing wrong with that. It's actually quite healthy, said Daniel Plants, the founder and chief investment officer of Voce Capital Management LLC, a $100 million activist hedge fund.Voce's campaigns have contributed to the sale of several U.S. companies, including the acquisition of medical helicopter operator Air Methods Corp by private equity firm American Securities LLC for $2.5 billion, which closed in April.More than 500 M&A-related campaign demands were madeby activists globally during the 2016 and 2017 proxy seasons, representing around 75 percent of the total number of demands, according to JPMorgan (JPM.N).Driving the trend are struggling mutual fund managers who support the deal campaigns to lock-in a positive return, and the decreasing number of targets where a quick fix can yield results, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N).The number of companies where a quick divestiture or capital allocation change will work is dwindling, said Avinash Mehrotra, Goldman's co-head of its shareholder advisory group, which advises companies on defending against activist investors. Infographic ID: '2eIUVwX'    Healthy WindfallFILE PHOTO: A combination photo shows food and plants for sale inside a Whole Foods Market in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo Allegri/File PhotoThe most high-profile example this year of activism prompting a sale was the nearly $300 million profit Jana Partners made on its three-month investment in Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O).Jana disclosed last week that it sold its entire 8.2 percent Whole Foods stake, worth $1 billion at the time and around 40 percent more than what it paid, after the organic grocer agreed to Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) $13.7 billion acquisition offer.Some activists also pile into companies already on the block, adding further pressure to seal the deal, a tactic applied in the sale of contract research firm Parexel International Corp. (PRXL.O).Fueling the frenzy has been a surge in overall M&A volumes during the past several years, underpinned by cheap financing and lofty valuations.Thanks in part to M&A, the performance of the HFRI ED Activist Index in the last 12 months is up 16.46 percent, the fourth best performer among all hedge fund strategies and a major turnaround from losses suffered last year.FILE PHOTO: The inside of a Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo Allegri/File PhotoActivists are pushing for strategic review because in a lot of situations, selling the company today at current valuation multiples offers a better risk-adjusted return than waiting for the current strategy to play out, said Waheed Hassan, who helps management teams defend against dissident shareholders as head of activist defense at advisory firm Alliance Advisors.The M&A push is not without risks.Powerful index funds such as BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N) and the Vanguard Group, which control a growing share of the stock market, are pressuring managements and other investors to choose long-term strategies over a tempting premium from a suitor.M&A plays can backfire when a company refuses to heed activists' calls for a sale, or a buyer fails to show up.Starboard Value LP, for example, suffered a 28 percent loss on its investment in Depomed Inc (DEPO.O) after the U.S. drugmaker explored a sale without success, according to research firm 13D Monitor.Another concern is that the pace of of U.S. deals slowed down in the first quarter.A slowdown in M&A would make activists revert to other strategies, such as seeking more operational fixes or share buybacks - though these demands usually yield smaller investment returns.Voce's Plants said activist hedge funds should avoid an investment strategy based solely on calling for company sales.It seems like a lot of funds are doing that now and I think it's very risky, he said.

The merger will give United Internet access to Drillisch's favorable mobile network terms and customer base, adding to the broadband infrastructure it has acquired and posing a more credible challenge to Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica Deutschland. The Drillisch shareholders voted by 98 percent in favor of a new share issue that will buy it 100 percent ownership of United Internet's premium 1&1 retail brand and give United Internet 73.1 percent of Drillisch in return, in the last step of a staggered stock-and-cash deal. The threshold for shareholder acceptance was 75 percent. The combined Drillisch and 1&1 - which will keep the Drillisch name and remain listed - will have more than 12 million subscribers and 3 billion euros in annual sales. Drillisch shares rose 2.2 percent to 57.20 euros by 1119 GMT, while United Internet shares rose 1.7 percent to 50.99 euros, outperforming the German Tecdax technology index, which rose 0.6 percent. I thank you sincerely for your trust, Drillisch Chief Executive Vlasios Choulidis told shareholders to applause at an extraordinary meeting in Frankfurt. In 1&1 we have an ideal partner with a extremely strong brand, a large customer base and enormous marketing capacity. Budget mobile operator Drillisch had argued that its shareholders would benefit overproportionally from the merger, contributing just 28 percent of subscribers, 18 percent of sales and 26 percent of core profit but being valued at 34 percent of the new, combined Drillisch and 1&1. The merger is expected to intensify competition in the German mobile market, where prices have held up well since its reduction to three network operators through the combination of Telefonica Deutschland and E-Plus in 2014. As part of the regulatory terms of the deal, Drillisch gained access on favorable terms to Telefonica Deutschland's mobile network - a benefit that will now flow to United Internet, enabling it to use more of that network capacity. United Internet, which also offers business-to-business and hosting services, acquired Germany's second-biggest fiber network after Deutsche Telekom's with the takeover of Versatel in 2014. It also owns 29 percent of Tele Columbus, Germany's third-largest cable operator. Deutsche Telekom shares rose 0.4 percent, broadly in line with the German blue-chip DAX, Vodafone shares rose 0.5 percent in London and Telefonica Deutschland shares rose 0.3 percent. Choulidis, who says he initiated the merger talks with United Internet CEO Ralph Dommermuth in March 2016, will become non-executive chairman of Drillisch once the deal is completed.Dommermuth will become CEO of Drillisch, Drillisch finance chief Andre Driesen will remain CFO and current 1&1 CEO Martin Witt will become chief operating officer. We're delighted at the clear approval which the Drillisch shareholders have given to the capital increase, Dommermuth said in a statement.

CKI, part of ports-to-telecoms conglomerate CK Hutchison (0001.HK), made a binding offer for private equity-owned Ista on Tuesday, the sources said, adding that two consortiums considered strong contenders refrained from making final bids. It remains unclear whether other final bids were submitted, they added. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which already owns a minority stake in Ista and had tied up with Blackstone (BX.N) to buy the whole company, was one of the contenders to hold back, as was a consortium of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Brookfield. Owner CVC is expected to choose a buyer this week, two of the sources said. Buyout group CVC, which bought Ista in 2013 at a valuation of 3.1 billion euros, had hoped to fetch up to 5 billion euros for Ista, equating to 12 times expected 2017 core profit (EBITDA) of 420 million euros, people familiar with the matter said last month. CVC declined to comment on Tuesday and a CKI representative was not immediately available for comment. The other investors declined to comment or were not immediately available. Ista, which provides energy and water metering, posted EBITDA of 370 million euros in 2016 on sales of 850 million euros. CKI has a market capitalization of HK$190 billion ($24 billion) and is invested in electricity generation and distribution, gas distribution, oil pipelines, water supply and wind power. Its European investments include a slew of British assets such as UK Power Networks, one of the largest electricity suppliers to London, as well as water, sewage and even rolling stock group UK Rail. It also owns the Netherlands' largest energy-from-waste company AVR and has interests in Portugal Renewable Energy. But so far it lists no German investments on its home page.The deal is being closely watched by investors ahead the planned sale of Ista peer Techem by Australian infrastructure investor Macquarie in the autumn, sources have said. European bankers are working on debt financing in excess of seven times Ista's EBITDA and some bankers are working on leverage levels as high as 8.5 times, banking sources said. CVC's adviser, Goldman Sachs, is offering staple financing of about 5.8 times, significantly lower than European banks, to comply with U.S. guidelines on leveraged lending.Hoping to attract sponsors, the staple is a hybrid facility that would allow dividend payments, the sources said.

The mandate for the U.S. initial public offering of Pactera, bought for $675 million in cash last year, is not yet official, the sources said, but the listing could come early next year. News of the appointment of Goldman Sachs, a Wall Street stalwart, is a boost for HNA, even if the mandate is not official. The sprawling conglomerate has seen its banking relationships come under scrutiny in recent weeks, as Beijing reins in what it sees as excessively splashy deals by China's top dealmakers. One of the sources said Pactera could see a $200 million pre-IPO funding round close in the third quarter, adding Goldman bankers had spoken to several Chinese institutional investors. Some global private equity firms could also be part of that, particularly those that lost out to Blackstone when it bought the business in 2014, the source said. The funds raised from the pre-IPO round would be used for a small acquisition deal that Pactera is trying to close in the United States, as well as debt repayment, the source added.Goldman advised HNA on the acquisition of Pactera. Pactera did not respond to requests for comment. HNA and Goldman declined to comment.On Monday, HNA brushed off concerns that some Wall Street banks were shying away from its business, and said it maintained a strong working relationship with key banks including JPMorgan (JPM.N), UBS (UBSG.S) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). FILE PHOTO: A Hainan Airlines plane takes off from the Sanya Phoenix International Airport in Sanya, Hainan province, China, May 1, 2015.Stringer/File PhotoSeveral of the banks have long-standing relationships dating back to HNA's days as a regional airline. But Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) pulled back, citing HNA's opaque ownership structure, according to the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal on Monday quoted an HNA letter to BAML questioning that decision. HNA Chief Executive Adam Tan said on Monday that BAML had not dealt closely with the group, in any event. HNA also announced a shareholding shake-up in a bid to quash concerns over its ownership. BAML declined to comment. Last month, China's banking regulator ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to a number of the more aggressive dealmakers, including HNA, property-to-film conglomerate Dalian Wanda and Anbang Insurance Group.Tan described the checks as routine. HNA's relationships have since been closely scrutinized, however, given key funding needs and some of its more sensitive connections, including to Anthony Scaramucci, the newly appointed communications director for the Trump administration. Scaramucci agreed in January to sell his hedge fund SkyBridge Capital LLC to HNA to clear the way for a job working with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Refresco said it would finance the deal with debt and then expected to issue $200 million in new shares within a year of closing the deal, which is expected in the second half of 2017. Cott's bottling activities made sales of around $1.7 billion in fiscal 2016, and earnings before interest, tax, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of nearly $137 million. Synergies of $47 million are expected over three years, due to lower costs. The transaction is expected to boost earnings in the first year of consolidation with about a 5 percent contribution, Roelofs said. ING analysts said there was a solid strategic rationale to the deal, but noted the expected boost to earnings did not take into account the dilution from the planned share issue.They have a buy rating on Refresco shares, which were down 2.5 percent to 16.75 euros at 0835 GMT.Refresco, which has bottling sites in New Jersey, Florida and Oklahoma, said 90 percent of customers in the United States would be within 400 miles of one of its bottling plants.

Analysts and investors have speculated that Amazon is aiming to combine its expertise in order fulfillment with the grocer's facilities to build out delivery of fresh food, but the online retailer has not yet detailed its plans. Amazon visited Georgia grass-fed meat producer White Oak Pastures in March, 2-1/2 months before announcing the $13.7 billion Whole Foods takeover, to discuss a possible distribution deal, White Oak owner Will Harris told Reuters. The retailer later asked the farmer to invite other U.S. livestock producers to discuss distribution of organic and grass-fed meat, Harris said.Amazon declined to comment. We are excited about exploring possibilities with them, Harris said. It suggests that this niche in the market is becoming mainstream enough that they feel their delivery system might have traction with it. U.S. sales of organic meat and poultry, worth $991 million, climbed 17 percent last year, marking its fastest-ever annual growth, according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA). White Oak and some of the other meat producers invited to the Atlanta meeting already sell to Whole Foods, Harris said.

I'm a farmer and they're logistics people.Slideshow (5 Images)The ranch sells about $2 million worth of meat online annually, making up its fastest-growing segment and 10 percent of total revenues. I sell a very niche product, Harris said. I think Amazon will add a whole other dimension. Amazon's expansion in organic products through Whole Foods bodes well for the sector, said Nate Lewis, farm policy director at OTA. If Amazon can apply its efficiencies of scale to the Whole Foods Market segment, and pass along those savings (to consumers), I would not be surprised to see more growth in the protein side, Lewis said. But some organic farmers worry that Whole Foods under Amazon might import meat from lower-cost producers rather than buy U.S. supplies. “It could be as bad as shutting us out or as good as expanding the market, said Mark Smith, whose Aspen Island Ranch is not involved in the meeting. Smith's ranch is part of a Montana co-operative that sells organic grass-fed beef to Whole Foods through a third party.

The privately-owned group, which has entered into $50 billion of deals over the last two years, buying stakes in logistics firms, hotels and even Deutsche Bank, said on Monday it has set up a new charitable foundation to act as its single biggest stakeholder. I think we are operating our company legally, we have nothing to hide, and we are fine, CEO Adam Tan told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview. Tan said that HNA maintains a strong working relationship with its main Wall Street banks, which include JPMorgan, UBS and Morgan Stanley, and reports that some were scaling back credit to the group were not true. He said Morgan Stanley had given HNA an unsecured $300 million loan just three weeks ago. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The only bank that has stopped working with HNA is Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Tan said, adding the bank had not dealt closely with HNA to begin with. Tan characterized as routine a loan check by banks ordered last month by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), adding this was not a major hindrance to the group's business, given it had already been subject to regular CBRC scrutiny. I've been reviewed by them (the CBRC) for more than 10 years, he said, adding it was just one of many regulators the company dealt with. Beijing is putting more pressure on opaque corporate structures, excess debt and deals it sees as overly aggressive as it tries to control capital outflows and keep its economy on an even keel. The banking regulator last month ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by a handful of Chinese companies that have been on an overseas buying spree.HNA, a leading shareholder in more than a dozen listed companies, has grown rapidly by buying overseas firms, more than quadrupling its assets to 1.2 trillion yuan ($177.5 billion) in 2014-16. Tan said revenues trebled in the first half of this year, and profits rose by 40 percent. He declined to elaborate. New Foundation Tan confirmed details of a shareholding reorganization at HNA, which was reported earlier by Reuters. HNA has come under pressure to provide greater clarity about who owns the conglomerate, following recent media reports and accusations by exiled billionaire Guo Wengui. In June, HNA filed a defamation suit at New York State Supreme Court against Guo, who claimed that officials in China's Communist Party and their relatives are undisclosed shareholders in the group. Under the reshuffle, a newly created, New York-based, not-for-profit organization, Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation Inc, has become HNA's single largest shareholder with a 29.5 percent stake. Hainan Province Cihang Charity Foundation, a Haikou-based charity established by HNA in 2010 and capitalized by shares in 2013, continues to indirectly hold a 22.75 percent stake - meaning the combined foundation collectively accounts for more than 52 percent of the group’s issued stock. A dozen senior executives hold the remainder of the group, with co-founders Chen Feng and Wang Jian having stakes of just below 15 percent each, Vice Chairman Chen Wenli a 3.95 percent stake, and three senior executives, including CEO Tan, each holding a 2.95 percent share. As recently as a year ago, according to a 2016 filing, HNA said Bharat Bhise, CEO of Bravia Capital, and Guan Jun, a Beijing businessman, owned 17.4 percent and 12.35 percent respectively. That shareholding had been transferred to the foundation, Tan said.Disclosing HNA Group’s ownership structure, even though we are a private company, provides more transparency, and we intend to update this information on an annual basis, a spokesman said. HNA described the foundation as furthering its philanthropic mission and maximising efforts in corporate social responsibility. HNA will exercise control and voting rights for the charities, Tan said, even as executives eventually move to transfer their shareholdings to the foundations. Deutsche, Skybridge Tan said he had not had contact with the European Central Bank, which is considering a possible assessment of Deutsche Bank's two largest shareholders, including the Qatari royal family.HNA holds a stake of just under 10 percent in Deutsche. I think the German government clearly said it welcomes all ... kinds of investment, he said. Our investment is legal and is totally controlled by the regulatory process. Tan said HNA continues to move forward with deals, even as its acquisition spree slows. He pointed to the recent announcement it would buy a 60 percent equity stake in Rio de Janeiro international airport for $19 million. Tan also said he was unaware of a timeline to close HNA Capital's proposed buyout of SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund platform founded by new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. The regulatory process may take more than a few weeks, he added. Reporting by Matthew Miller and Rachel Armstrong. with additional reporting by Olivia Oran in NEW YORK; Editing by Ian Geoghegan"

The WebMD deal is five months after the New York-based company said it would explore strategic options amid a slowdown in advertising paid for by pharmaceutical companies. KKR will fold WebMD's websites, including WebMD.com and Medscape.com, into its Internet Brands unit, which houses sites such as DentalPlans.com and AllAboutCounseling.com. KKR's Herald Chen said in an interview that Internet Brands will take what it has learned selling marketing services subscriptions, which bring in more recurring revenue than advertising, and apply a similar strategy to WebMD. We think there are many ways to expand on WebMD's current platforms and also build new solutions, Chen said.KKR will pay $66.50 per share, a premium of 20.5 percent to WebMD's Friday closing and 33 percent higher than the stock's trading price at the start of the year. WebMD's shares closed up 20 percent at $66.10, just shy of the offer price. Analysts said the deal price was higher than expected, adding that WebMD was a good fit for Internet Brands' portfolio. We are pleasantly surprised by the premium valuation, given the flat growth expected, Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee wrote in a note. Co-CEO of KKR, Henry R. Kravisat Trump Tower in New York, U.S., January 12, 2017.Mike SegarBlue Harbour Group, an activist hedge fund that owns 9 percent of WebMD shares, said in a statement that it supported the deal and that the company had conducted a thorough strategic process. Founded in 1996, WebMD has grown into one of the most popular health websites for consumers and medical professionals, attracting more than 70 million monthly unique visitors in 2016, according to analytics company comScore Inc. WebMD's Medscape, a medical news and education website, accounted for about 60 percent of the company's advertising revenue in 2016. Internet Brands, which launched as CarsDirect.com in 1998, licenses and delivers its content and internet technology products and services to small and medium-sized businesses. It was acquired by KKR in 2014 for $1.1 billion from two other private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman LLC and JMI Equity. Reuters reported on Sunday that KKR was nearing a deal to buy the online health information provider. Separately, KKR said it would buy a majority stake of the Nature's Bounty Company from the Carlyle Group. Carlyle will retain a significant stake in the company. Financial terms of that deal were not disclosed.WebMD also announced preliminary second-quarter sales that topped the average analyst estimate. J.P.

There are still a number of key points that remain to be agreed. If we manage to come to terms on these points, then it could lead to a very quick transaction. If not, any deal would remain at bay. Others saw a deal being done by late summer. Given the way talks are progressing, I would be surprised if we don't have a deal in September, said another source on the other side of the table.Spotify Takes Wing Sweden's Spotify has grown in less than a decade into the world's most popular streaming music service, but its financial sustainability hinges on its ability to strike music licensing contracts at less onerous royalty rates..Basic features of Spotify are free and supported by advertising while paying subscribers enjoy unlimited listening and other premium features. It faces mounting competition from far bigger internet players such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), which can afford to subsidize their push into music by drawing on money they make in other businesses. The streaming firm, which was recently valued at $13 billion, is pushing for a 50-50 revenue split but Warner Music is demanding it retains at least 52 percent of the royalties, in line with the other labels, according to the sources. Under the terms of their current agreement, Spotify pays 55 percent of royalties to Warner. Warner is also pushing to receive a guaranteed upfront payment regardless of subscription growth, said one of the sources. The label, owned by billionaire investor Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, is also asking for protection against thepotential rise of unsigned artists who could over time reduce its revenue share. A smartphone with a headset with Spotify logo are seen in front of a displayed Warner Music logo in this illustration picture taken July 24, 2017.Dado RuvicThis follows recent press reports that Spotify was filling its playlists with anonymous or little known artists to reduce the influence of the majors, said one of the sources. Warner would be ready to reduce its royalties rate from 55 percent to 52 percent provided these issues were resolved, said the same person. Spotify declined to comment. Other Deals Earlier this year, the Swedish company struck a licensing deal with Vivendi's (VIV.PA) Universal Music Group (UMG) to pay the world's largest label a lower royalty rate. This was recently followed by a similar agreement with Sony Music. Spotify didn't disclose the terms of the deals but it was widely reported that the streaming firm had managed to lower the royalty rate from about 57 percent to 52 percent, based on growing volumes of paying listeners. Slideshow (2 Images)In return, the streaming service agreed to restrict new albums to paying subscribers for a couple of weeks before offering access to free users. As of June, Spotify had 53 million paying users or 40 percent of streaming music subscribers worldwide, according to MIDiA Research. It has more than 140 million active users, including free listeners. By comparison, Apple had 19 percent, or 28.2 million music subscribers, in June, up from 20 million in December, while Amazon held 12 percent, or 16 million subscribers, MIDiA estimated. Heading for the Market One of the sources said Spotify, which hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to advise it on a stock market listing, is still aiming to go public via a direct listing toward the end of this year or the beginning of the next.Spotify recorded revenues of 2.9 billion euros for 2016, up 51 percent from 2015, according to company filings in Luxembourg in June.Operating losses grew 48 percent to 349.4 million euros, but including financing costs, its losses before tax leapt 133 percent to 539 million euros. Last year, Universal held a 28.9 percent share of global music label revenue, Sony Music generated 22.4 percent and Warner 17.4 percent. Independent labels made up the remaining 31.3 percent, according to MIDiA Research. The company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions, according to analysts.

A very broad term, it includes anything from a bank ATM, to software used to help spot manipulation of securities markets.CRYPTOCURRENCY: A digital currency that relies on cryptography to validate and secure transactions. There are different types of cryptocurrencies - bitcoin and Ether are among the best known.BITCOIN: A digital - or crypto - currency that enables payment in a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network not governed by any central authority or middleman.BLOCKCHAIN: Software that first emerged as the system underpinning bitcoin. Also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), it is a shared record of information that is maintained and updated by a network of computers rather than a central authority. It is protected and secured by advanced cryptography.ETHEREUM: A type of blockchain network. The bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains differ primarily in purpose and capability. While the bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of the digital currency bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain can be used to build decentralized applications. The virtual currency associated with Ethereum is called Ether.P2P LENDING: Also known as social lending, peer-to-peer lenders run websites where borrowers can secure money directly from lenders bypassing banks.SMART CONTRACTS: Software that runs on blockchain technology and can automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. A “smart bond”, for example would automatically make interest payments to investors.  ROBO-ADVICE: Financial advice given through the use of computer algorithms. Robo-advisors, also known as online investment managers, typically invest their clients’ money in portfolios made up of low cost exchange-traded funds.INSURTECH: Inspired by the term fintech, insurtech champions the use of technology to modernize and improve the insurance business.REGTECH: Or regulatory technology. The term refers to software and other technology aimed at helping financial services businesses comply with regulations efficiently and inexpensively, or regulators enforce rules.OPEN BANKING: A term used to refer to the use of open APIs by banks to enable third party software developers to create applications and software using the bank’s data. APIs are application programming interfaces, a set of instructions and tools that enable software developers to create applications that can interact with another company’s systems. For example, by connecting to a bank’s API, a fintech startup could develop a mobile phone app that moves money in an out from the accounts of a bank’s customers, or simply lets them check their balance.UNDERBANKED/UNBANKED: People or businesses that have little or no access to mainstream financial services. The World Bank estimates that there are 2 billion adults worldwide without access to formal financial services.FINANCIAL INCLUSION: Term used to refer to financial products and services aimed at providing more affordable and mainstream options to the underbanked. In fintech, this often involves taking advantage of technology, such as mobile phones, to offer cheaper services to those who have been traditionally overlooked by banks and other financial firms.ICO: Initial Coin Offering, or a token sale. The process or event in which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture and contributors receive tokens in return.EQUITY-CROWDFUNDING: When people invest through a website in a company not yet listed on a stock exchange and receive back shares in the firm.More generic terminology often heard in fintech spheres:KYC: Or know your client/customer. A process to ensure businesses identify and verify the identity of their clients, for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes.ENCRYPTION: The process of encoding messages. Once something has been encrypted, a key is required to turn that code back into useful data.OMNI CHANNEL: A retail model that integrates different purchasing methods for customers such as online, by phone or in store. Omnichannel banking, for example, means offering banking across those three methods.ACCELERATORS AND INCUBATORS: Organizations that select entrepreneurs or startups and offer them coaching, mentoring as well as exposure to potential clients and investors - often in exchange for an equity stake.Sources: Reuters, PwC, Investopedia, Dataconomy, Blockgeeks"

Prominent venture capitalists Tim Draper and Blockchain Capital co-founder Brock Pierce told Reuters they have participated in coin offerings.Related CoverageFintech 'lingo' explainedMany of these VC firms also take equity in the start-ups that issue the coins.However, venture capital firms moving into the world of digital currencies face unprecedented pushback. Some issuers limit the size of pre-sale deals, making venture capital firms scramble like everybody else for sought-after public offers.Pierce of Blockchain Capital said the old business model that gave venture capitalists and founders the lion's share of a company no longer worked with blockchain firms.Whether VCs like it or not, venture capital will become a very small part of capital formation, he said.The reason is that firms issue tokens not only to raise money but also to attract a broad group of enthusiasts who can help develop their projects hoping to lift the value of their investments.FILE PHOTO: Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 2015.Benoit Tessier/File PhotoTokens can galvanize a community: lots of individuals and corporations are able to work together and improve a decentralized network, said Ryan Shea, co-founder of tech start-up Blockstack in New York.Blockstack recently launched a new browser that will give users access to new applications on their own devices without remote servers.For Blockstack's own token launch later this year, Shea said the firm plans a combination of a crowdsale and so-called mining, in which market participants solve complex mathematical problems to release a coin. I think if you have a few venture capitalists that come in and sweep up all the tokens, to me that's a failed token sale, Shea added.Stelian Balta, developer, entrepreneur as well as founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based hedge fund HyperChain Capital, is one such investor issuers target.We help in the security audit of the tokens, we help introduce developers for coding purposes, and we have introduced the start-ups to our own network of connections, he said.Robust ReturnsVenture capital firms' digital currency investments still account for only a sliver of the roughly $19.3 billion they have invested in tech-related sectors in the first half of 2017, according to data from consulting firm PwC and research firm CB Insights.But the double-digit returns coins have delivered over the past few years is not something venture capital investors want to pass up.According to tokendata.io, a new website that tracks initial coin offerings, these tokens trade on the exchanges at 20 times their initial sale price on average. That number is skewed by high-performing outliers and the median multiple is three.Yet VCs sometimes have to make do with less than they bid for in token sales.For example, U.S. startup Civic, which is building an identity verification network, trimmed venture capital firms' and other institutional orders in a pre-sale of its token, the company's co-founder and chief executive Vinny Lingham told Reuters.Venture capitalists recognize digital coin sales as a genuine disruptive force, but argue they still have a role to play - helping blockchain startups build teams and devise longer-term business strategies.The investors who bought your token, like public market investors, may be gone tomorrow, next month, or next year, having moved on to the next big thing, said Fred Wilson co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which has participated in coin sales. VCs, at least the best ones, are there for your company in good times and bad.Yet as long as coin sales provide quick, hassle-free access to funds, start-ups tend to focus on technical expertise and see less urgency to tap venture capital funds.People who provide value are those who have insight on how blockchain works, said Jake Brukhman, a partner at U.S.-based CoinFund, which invests in tokens. I think VCs are two years behind on blockchain.Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Tomasz Janowski"

A PayPal employee demonstrates one of the company's options to pay with a mobile device at store within a PayPal office building in San Jose, California May 28, 2014.Beck DiefenbachDan Schulman has been very vocal about supporting the underserved, Orloff said, referring to PayPal's chief executive. PayPal has been expanding partnerships and acquiring new services to gain advantage over rivals in a highly competitive digital payments market. LendUp describes its first product, LendUp Ladder, as an alternative to traditional payday loans. It carries a flat fee and allows users to borrow more if they earn points by paying back their loans on time or watching financial education videos. It also offers a credit card that does not require a security deposit.The company, however, has been the subject of regulatory actions over its business practices. Last September the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered LendUp to pay $3.6 million in fines and refunds to customers over lending practices that took place from 2012 to 2014. The same month, the company agreed to pay $2.7 million in a settlement with the California Department of Business Oversight over allegations of illegal fees and violations of payday and installment lending laws. Orloff said that in its early days the company did not have the team in place to understand the complexities of the financial services space, but has since built up its legal and compliance team.Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Leslie Adler"

The decision creates another obstacle for Knorr-Bremse after Haldex's management dropped its support for the 5.5 billion crown ($673 million) all-cash takeover offer last month because of regulatory opposition. The European Commission listed on Monday a number of areas where competition would be reduced following the deal, including in electronic braking systems, air disc brakes, anti-lock braking systems and air treatment systems. We want to ensure that Knorr-Bremse's takeover of Haldex does not restrict competition for these critical components which could lead to less innovation, for example in the development of automated driving, or to price increases for vehicle manufacturers, fleet operators and ultimately consumers, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The EU competition enforcer said Knorr-Bremse's offer of concessions had not addressed the concerns and therefore it had not sought feedback from rivals and users, confirming a Reuters story on July 5. It will decide by Nov. 30 whether to clear or block the deal.Knorr-Bremse said the merger made commercial sense despite the possibility of major asset sales to address regulatory concerns. The transaction follows a compelling rationale in spite of potential remedies.

The performance solutions business makes surface and coating materials used in electronics, automotive production, commercial packaging and printing.The agricultural solutions business, which is currently up for sale, offers agrochemicals to protect from weeds, insects and diseases.

Eminence Capital said in a letter that Sabra's deal would reverse the company's efforts to reduce exposure to skilled nursing facilities. Sabra owns real estate properties that serve the healthcare industry in the United States and Canada. Care Capital has a portfolio of healthcare properties focusing on the post-acute care sector. Sabra, which has a market valuation of about $1.6 billion, said in May it would buy Care Capital in an all-stock deal that would value the combined company at about $4.3 billion. Sabra had said it would benefit from lower costs of capital by merging with Care Capital and that the deal would add to its earnings immediately. Hudson Bay said the deal would not reduce Sabra's cost of capital but increase it.

The Japanese drugmaker said on Monday it was particularly attracted by Neuroderm's Parkinson's disease drug that is in advanced clinical trials in the United States and Europe and is expected to go on sale in the 2019 financial year. It said the deal was intended to help it achieve its U.S. sales target of 80 billion yen ($722 million) by its 2020 financial year.The deal will be the largest ever purchase of an Israeli firm by a Japanese company, surpassing internet retailer Rakuten Inc's (4755.T) $900 million acquisition of chat app Viber in 2014. It will also be the largest acquisition of an Israeli pharmaceutical company. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma will pay $39 for each Neuroderm share, a premium of about 17 percent to its Friday close. The deal has the backing of Neuroderm's board and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 following shareholder and regulatory approvals. The price is also a 79 percent premium to Neuroderm's share price on June 9, before the stock began climbing on media reports the company was considering a sale. Neuroderm's Nasdaq-listed shares were up 15.2 percent at $38.25 in pre-market trade. Given the significant premium offered and existing shareholder agreements, we regard a counter bid to perhaps be unlikely, Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said in a note to clients.

Chinese peer Didi Chuxing and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) will contribute most of the money, which a person close to the Singapore-based firm said would value it at $6 billion. The investment would be the latest in a Southeast Asian tech startup as major companies seek growth in the region's huge developing economies with young, tech-savvy demographics. Chinese social media firm Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) put up to $150 million into Grab's Indonesian peer Go-Jek, sources said this month, while in June, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) spent an additional $1 billion to raise its stake in Singapore-based e-tailer Lazada. Grab's fresh fundraising is a real endorsement of the potential and promise of Southeast Asia's startup community, said Dane Anderson, a vice president at researcher Forrester. Didi and SoftBank are already investors in Grab and other ride-hailing services globally. The pair will add $2 billion, and with $500 million from others, the fundraising will be Southeast Asia's biggest-ever single round of financing, Grab said on Monday. With their support, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ride-sharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for Southeast Asia, Anthony Tan, group chief executive officer and Grab co-founder, said in a statement. Consumer Tech Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries with 1.1 million drivers. It said it has a market share of 95 percent in third-party taxi-hailing and 71 percent in private vehicle hailing in Southeast Asia. But its share could be under threat as San Francisco-based Uber, the world's largest ride-hailing service, is expected to increase its focus on the region after it folded its China business into Didi last year. Earlier this month, Uber also agreed to combine its Russian ride-sharing business with Yandex NV (YNDX.O), the Google of Russia. Grab said it plans to expand its research and development expertise and look for any strategic investment opportunities. Building on soaring user numbers of its Grab ride-hailing app and GrabPay function, the firm aims to transform into a consumer technology firm that also offers loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. As part of that ambition, the five-year-old startup bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. The heterogeneity of the banking system, multiple competitors in each country, and multiple regulations to meet are barriers to success, said analyst Rushabh Doshi at researcher Canalys. However, given no single payment solution has been able to work across all Southeast Asian markets, Grab stands a good chance of building market share via its ride-sharing business model, and then extending the payments to other adjunct businesses, he said. Investors in Grab's previous fundraising include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp [CIC.UL], hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital, and Vertex Ventures Holdings - a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd [TEM.UL].

However, the rise indicated a value for B&M; much lower than the reported takeover value, indicating that investors were not convinced by the report. The Sunday Times said Asda, which trails market leader Tesco and Sainsbury's in annual sales, is in the early stages of assessing a bid for B&M;, which is chaired by Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco. It said Asda had commissioned external research on B&M; and cited an unidentified industry source as saying that buying B&M; would reduce Asda's reliance on food sales and provide it with a network to stock its George clothing range. Spokesmen for Asda and B&M; both declined to comment. Shares in B&M;, which listed at 270 pence in 2014, were up 15.4 pence at 356.2 pence at 0754 GMT, valuing the business at 3.6 billion pounds. The Sunday Times said applying a normal takeover premium would take Asda's offer price to at least 4.4 billion pounds. If the City really believed the Sunday Times story about an Asda bid the shares would be a lot higher, said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. Given that Wal-Mart had been thought to be weighing up selling Asda at one point, it would certainly represent quite a change in attitude to M&A; in the UK on their part, he said. B&M;, which trades from more than 540 UK stores, selling products ranging from bedding to barbecues to food, is run by Chief Executive Simon Arora and his brother Bobby, the trading director. The Arora family own a 15 percent stake. If Asda did go for B&M; it would follow other deals by Britain's major supermarkets looking to diversify and protect market share from discounters Aldiand Lidland from Amazon. Last year Sainsbury’s bought Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.1 billion pounds and has also held takeover talks with franchised convenience chain Nisa, while in January Tesco agreed on a 3.7 billion pound takeover of wholesaler Booker, a deal which is currently being investigated by competition regulators.

It is the second time Westpac has put Hastings up for sale in as many years and three analysts contacted by Reuters put the potential price between A$250 million ($200 million) and A$600 million. Westpac, Charter Hall and Hastings declined to comment on the potential sale price. The mooted deal follows stiffer bank capital rules in the country, designed to protect them from financial shocks. This has spurred big banks to sell capital-intensive assets such as insurance and fund management businesses. Hastings Fund Management specializes in buying and managing infrastructure, property, alternative debt and private equity and in recent years bought a power grid and the land title registry in New South Wales state. If you see the capital requirement going up and you need more capital, you can either raise capital or you can sell stuff that doesn't quite strategically fit, and it's the latter, CLSA banking analyst Brian Johnson said of the deal. Westpac tried to sell the unit last year but withdrew from sale talks, citing adverse market conditions. National Australia Bank, among Australia's 'Big Four' lenders, last year spun off its struggling U.K. operations, withdrew from underperforming businesses in the United States and sold 80 percent of its life insurance business to Japan's Nippon Life for A$2.4 billion. And Australia and New Zealand Banking Group agreed to sell its wealth and retail businesses in five Asian markets to Singapore's biggest lender, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, for around S$110 million in 2016.

Oaktree last week asked other shareholders to reject Rayonier's deal, terming it as a flawed sale process, and that there was a significant value gap between the offer price and the real value of Tembec. Oaktree and Bennett together own about 37 percent of Tembec's outstanding shares. Under the revised terms, Tembec shareholders could elect to receive either C$4.75 in cash or 0.2542 share of Rayonier common stock per Tembec common share, subject to proration so that about 67 percent of total consideration in cash and about 33 percent is paid in Rayonier common stock. Rayonier, which makes high-value cellulose specialties fibers, said in May it would buy Tembec for C$4.05 per share, to expand into packaging and forest products. Including debt of $487 million, the deal was then valued at about $807 million. The deal was already approved by Germany's federal cartel office in July.

The merger and possible sale of more of the government's holding are part of efforts to increase the value of both banks following a combined 24 billion euro ($27.98 billion) bailout at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. The deal is to be confirmed in September at a shareholder meeting. If the merger is approved, it will leave the state with 66.56 percent of the new entity, while Bankia shareholders and BMN shareholders will hold 33.1 and 2.33percent of shares, respectively. By increasing the proportion of publicly traded shares, Bankia could prove more attractive for institutional investors, de Guindos suggested. The government sold a stake in Bankia in 2014 and in December passed a law giving until the end of 2019 to privatize the bank to try to recoup money provided under its rescue in 2012. The minister predicted that the Spanish economy would continue growing this year and comfortably meet a 3 percent GDP growth forecast.

Grupo Biotoscana SA, a Colombia-based pharmaceutical firm, and shareholders raised 1.34 billion reais ($426.7 million) in a Friday IPO. Three days earlier, the IPO of Brazil's biggest diversified retailer Grupo Carrefour Brasil SA fetched 5.12 billion reais. That marked the busiest week for local equity offerings since April 25, 2013, when the IPOs of insurer BB Seguridade Participações SA (BBSE3.SA) and loyalty program Smiles SA raised 12.6 billion reais. Brazilian stocks .BVSP and its currency BRBY have outperformed Latin American peers in recent weeks as President Michel Temer's plan to revamp labor regulations cleared Congress before its winter break, suggesting resilient lawmaker support for his reform agenda despite the nation's political crisis. With the labor reform approved and Congress in recess, there's a window of opportunity for companies looking to seize on demand for Brazilian equities, said one fund manager who participated in the Carrefour listing. This week's successful transactions spell good news for reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA and renewable power firm Omega Geração SA, whose shares are scheduled to debut on the São Paulo Stock Exchange in coming weeks. Extending the current wave of offerings hinges, at least in part, on Temer's ability to garner support for an ambitious pension code reform when Congress returns in August, bankers said. Bankers said companies seeking to tap local equity markets needed to balance risks and returns as Brazil slowly emerges from recession against the backdrop of escalating corruption allegations against Temer. Uncertainty has kept many foreign investors - traditionally the main buyers of Brazilian IPOs - on the sidelines.Foreigners snapped up just 54 percent of Brazilian IPOs this year, prior to this week, compared with the 67 percent over the previous decade, data showed. However, most buyers in the Biotoscana listing were foreign institutional funds, a person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters, suggesting that uneasiness may be starting to abate. Investors stung by a string of deals in recent years that failed to deliver promised returns are wary of IPOs in Brazil.

It was sold to private equity firm L Catterton in 2012, after the founder's son, Nello Ferrara, died. Under L Catterton's ownership, Ferrara merged with another of the buyout firm's portfolio companies, Farley's & Sathers Candy company, owner of sugar-coated jelly brand Chuckles and other candies. Ferrara had explored a sale earlier this year that it hoped would value it at more than $1.3 billion, but terminated the sale process after disagreements over price.

The FTC is probing a complaint brought by the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which looked at some 1,000 products on Amazon's website in June and found that Amazon put reference prices, or list prices, on about 46 percent of them. An analysis found that in 61 percent of products with reference prices, Amazon's reference prices were higher than it had sold the same product in the previous 90 days, Consumer Watchdog said in a letter to the FTC dated July 6. Following receipt of the letter, the agency made informal inquiries about the allegations, according to a source who spoke on background to preserve business relationships.Related CoverageAmazon spent $3.2 million in second quarter on Washington lobbying effortThe FTC declined comment for this story. It was not known if the agency would open a formal probe into the allegations. Amazon closed up slightly for the day at $1,028.70.

The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal RossignolThe conclusions the Consumer Watchdog group reached are flat out wrong, Amazon said. We validate the reference prices provided by manufacturers, vendors and sellers against actual prices recently found across Amazon and other retailers. The review of Amazon's discount pricing is an indication the FTC is taking a serious look at the e-commerce company's agreement to buy Whole Foods, a deal that critics say could give Amazon an unfair advantage.   Consumer Watchdog argued that the deceptive list prices make Amazon prices look like a bargain, and asked the FTC to stop Amazon from buying Whole Foods while the deceptive discounting is occurring.The FTC plays a dual role of probing charges of deceptive advertising and assessing mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law. Amazon said in June that it would buy the premium grocer for $13.7 billion. The FTC's Guide Against Deceptive Pricing warns against using a fictitious or inflated list price for the purpose of making the price charged look like a bargain. Amazon settled similar allegations with Canada's Competition Bureau in January. It paid a fine of C$1 million ($756,658.60) as part of the settlement.

Amazon has lobbied to be able to accept food stamps online and is participating in a pilot program.

Fudge's letter was made public by the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW), which represents many of the unionized grocery workers in the United States. Fudge's office confirmed she had sent the letter. Amazon's plan announced in June to buy premium grocer Whole Foods roiled the grocery industry and sparked worries the deal could raise prices, reduce the quality of products and hurt employment.Still, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. The letter asking for more scrutiny was praised by the UFCW union. “Political concerns about Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods are growing for good reason,” UFCW President Marc Perrone said on Friday. “Amazon’s monopolistic desire to control the retail market and replace good jobs with automation is not only a direct threat to the hard-working men and women at Whole Foods, it’s also a direct threat to our economy and consumers.Amazon has sought to dispute that it would monopolize the grocery industry.

The industrial group said it now had credible evidence that all four gas turbines it delivered a year ago for a project in southern Russia had been illegally moved to Crimea, confirming a series of Reuters reports. The move is embarrassing for Russia, which stands accused of disregarding EU sanctions, flouting its original agreement with Siemens and going back on assurances made to Berlin. A spokesman for the German government said on Friday that it had received high-level assurances from Russia that the turbines would not end up in Crimea. That followed a report in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaperthat said Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the assurance personally to Germany's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, in September. Asked by Reuters about similar reports in business weekly WirtschaftsWoche, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment.The Kremlin also declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the companies involved, but the situation could now makeEuropean companies more cautious about doing business in Russia. Siemens said it had not yet found proof that it had violated sanctions itself, reiterating that the turbines had been modified locally and unlawfully moved to Crimea against its will and in breach of contractual agreements. Supportive Shareholders Related CoverageRussia to press ahead with Crimea power plants despite Siemens row: RIAKremlin says to keep mum on Siemens' Russia retreat over Crimea scandalCrimea is subject to EU sanctions on energy equipment since Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula in 2014. President Putin has promised to provide the region with a stable energy supply. This development constitutes a blatant breach of Siemens' delivery contracts, trust and EU regulations, Siemens said, adding that it would take immediate and decisive action if it discovered further indications that export control regulations had been violated. Siemens shareholders appeared supportive of its response. Fund manager Max Anderl of UBS Asset Management, one of the top 20 investors in Siemens, said: You could ask for the products back, but if the customer does not cooperate there is little that can be done. The quick reaction time and the decision taken today show strong governance. Siemens said it would now divest its minority stake in joint venture Interautomatika (IA), which sources have told Reuters was involved in the installation and commissioning of the turbines in Crimea, and suspend its two representatives on IA's supervisory board. Siemens has a 45.7 percent stake in the business. FILE PHOTO: A still image taken from video footage shows blue tarpaulins covering equipment at the port of Feodosia, Crimea July 11, 2017.Staff/File PhotoSiemens said it had also reviewed its licensing agreements with Russian companies associated with the matter and was reviewing potential cooperation between its subsidiaries and other entities around the world regarding deliveries to Russia. Matthias Schepp, head of the German-Russian chamber of commerce, said: German companies ought to be able to depend on contracts being upheld. The German-Russian chamber of commerce is not aware of any violations on the part of German companies. Long History Munich-based multinational Siemens has been active for 170 years in Russia, where its primary activities are supplying energy equipment and rail technology.Its business there has slowed in recent years as the Russian economy was hit by falling oil prices and the impact of sanctions. Siemens achieved sales of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in Russia last year, about 2 percent of its total. FILE PHOTO: The Siemens AG headquarters is seen in Munich, Germany, June 14, 2016.Michaela Rehle/File PhotoIt was not clear whether Russia might retaliate against Siemens by ending cooperation in other areas. Russia uses Siemens trains on its high-speed Sapsan rail network. However, those trains cost Moscow more than 1 billion euros to buy and cover with a 30-year Siemens service contract. Siemens, which also has a passenger train manufacturing joint venture in Russia, said it would put in place additional controls to ensure that energy equipment will in future be dispatched only once the company has confirmed it can be installed at the agreed destination. Any new business in gas turbine equipment will be executed only by its majority-owned Siemens Gas Turbines Technologies joint venture with Russia's Power Machines, and its wholly owned subsidiary, OOO Siemens, it said. Siemens spokesman Wolfram Trost said the Crimean affair had not sparked a wider review of compliance at Siemens, which battled a worldwide bribery scandal a decade ago, resulting in a then-record $1.6 billion fine from the U.S. Justice Department. Siemens renewed its offer to buy back the turbines and cancel the original contract with state-owned Technopromexport (TPE), against whom it is taking legal action intended to stop further deliveries to Crimea and to return the turbines to their original destination of Taman in southern Russia. Evgeny Rodin, partner at Moscow law firm Vegas Lex, said he doubted that the turbines would be returned.One can assume that while the legal case is ongoing the turbines will be installed, he said. Russia will press ahead with plans to build two new power stations in Crimea, the RIA news agency reported Andrei Cherezov, a Russian deputy energy minister, as saying. Technopromexport, which is now building the new Crimean power plants, did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

The deal, which would create two separate joint ventures for their signaling and rolling-stock divisions, could be announced as early as August, the sources said.Siemens' supervisory board will discuss the matter at its meeting on Aug. 2, while Bombardier's board is expected to consider it before the company's second-quarter earnings call next week, the sources said, adding that an announcement could come in early August.All of the sources, including one who talked to Reuters earlier in the week, spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.Rail consolidation has been a trend over the last few years, as global companies seek to contain costs and Western companies struggle with the rising ambitions of China's state-backed CRRC at home and abroad. Media reports in April that Siemens and Bombardier explored a combination with total sales of $16 billion had sparked antitrust concerns in Europe. Bombardier would take just over a 50 percent stake in the joint rolling stock operations, one source said. Siemens would take roughly an 80 percent stake in a joint venture in the higher-margin signaling technology, two of the sources said.While a deal could be a win-win for both companies, any agreement that largely cedes control over Bombardier's lucrative signaling business to Siemens, the market leader, could worry the Canadian company's investors, an analyst said. A logo of Siemens is pictured on a building in Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2017.Edgard GarridoNevertheless, a tie-up could help Bombardier, the rail industry's fifth-largest signaling player by market share, grow that business, the analyst said. Bombardier and Siemens declined to comment. No money would be exchanged as part of the deal, two of the sources said.It was not yet clear what role Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which owns a 30 percent stake in Bombardier Transportation, would play in the deal. A spokesman for the Caisse, Canada's second-largest pension fund, would not comment on Friday.Caisse Chief Executive Officer Michael Sabia told Reuters in June that he supports rail consolidation in general to create value and to begin leveling the market, given CRRC's size advantage. The proposed deal would also address antitrust concerns and fears that a tie-up would result in job losses. The companies have offered extensive job guarantees to get backing from the strong German labor side, two of the sources said. Bombardier and Siemens also would have to sell off some high-speed train operations to address the antitrust concerns. The advisers for Siemens are Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas, and UBS for Bombardier. The banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Siemens shares fell almost 2 percent while Bombardier was unchanged.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), owner of the popular photo-messaging app Snapchat, and meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) are trading well below the prices they listed at earlier this year. And though the U.S. IPO market has already raked in more money so far this year than it did in all of 2016, the underperformance of these stocks has sensitized investors to valuations and made them cautious about putting money on the table, IPO experts said. Second half of 2017 will be better than 2016, but we might not get to the 2015, 2014 levels this year, said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital LLC, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. This puts a damper on an IPO market that was largely expected to make a strong comeback after a poor 2016, especially for technology companies that typically bring in the highest proceeds. Richard Truesdell, co-head of global capital markets at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, said there were worries that over-valuation would lead to fewer tech IPOs and more conservative valuations this year than originally predicted. A star-studded lineup of companies including ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], home-sharing company Airbnb and music streaming service Spotify were expected to make their debuts in 2017, but are yet to file with regulators.Uber, valued over $60 billion, has other problems as well. The company, beset by complaints about its workplace culture, is also facing a federal inquiry and has been sued by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). Snap currently trades about 15 percent below its IPO price of $17, while Blue Apron is down about 35 percent from its IPO price of $10. Snap in May reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first quarter after its IPO. Blue Apron is yet to report results after going public. A strong after-debut performance often rests on a company's profitability and Snap and Blue Apron's lack of profits in the face of stiff competition from deep-pocketed rivals have raised questions about their ability to turn around. There's hope yet. A few bright spots in the IPO market, including big-data analytics company Cloudera Inc's (CLDR.N) debut, could help boost investor enthusiasm as long as valuations rationalize over the next couple of months. Cloudera joins a small group of companies whose stocks have done well after their listings, including Canadian apparel maker Canada Goose Holdings Inc (GOOS.TO) (GOOS.N) and flooring retailer Floor & Decor Holdings Inc (FND.N). The Renaissance IPO ETF is up 25 percent this year, far outperforming the 9 percent increase in the S&P; 500 index .SPX. Several private companies are expected to seek public listing in the second half of 2017, according to Renaissance Capital.

Royalty deals give the owner the right to receive a percentage of revenue or profits from a mining operation, often in exchange for financing. Reuters reported in May that Glencore had hired the Bank of Nova Scotia to sell its royalty assets, including one for the Antamina copper-zinc mine in Peru, which was expected to fetch up to $250 million. The sources said on Friday it was now in talks to create a 50:50 venture for the assets with Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.A separate vehicle would help Glencore to secure supplies of copper, zinc and nickel for its trading unit. Both companies would also expand the portfolio by purchasing royalties from other miners' operations, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Glencore declined to comment and Ontario Teachers was not immediately available for comment.Ontario Teachers, Canada's third biggest pension fund with net assets of more than C$175 billion ($139 billion), has some natural resources investments and also royalty interests in oil and gas, according to its website. Glencore is looking to maximize the value of its assets as it moves from cost-cutting to pursuing growth. Last month, it embarked in a bidding war with China's Yancoal for the Australian thermal coal assets being sold by Rio Tinto, while in May the miner approached U.S. grain trader Bunge Ltd over a potential business combination. Glencore, which owns a 33.75 percent stake in Antamina, has already monetized a portion of the mine's output.Glencore's partners in Antamina are Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton Plc with a 33.75 percent stake, Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd, with 22.5 percent and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp with 10 percent.

Sprint Corp (S.N) acquired Clearwire in 2013 after a bidding war with Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) pushed the price to $5 per share, valuing Clearwire at about $14 billion.After Clearwire shareholders approved the deal, an affiliate of Aurelius that had opposed the Sprint acquisition brought what is known as an appraisal action, asking a judge to determine fair value of the stock. The affiliate had sought $16.08 for each of its 25 million shares, or about $400 million. Vice Chancellor Travis Laster on Friday sided with Clearwire, which had said the fair price was $2.13 per share, or about $53 million for the fund's stock. Aurelius will also collect interest. The ruling stands out for a court that rarely finds fair value below deal price, let alone more than 50 percent below. The decision can be appealed.A spokesman for Aurelius, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), said it was pleased the court recognized Clearwire shareholders received a significant premium. Wall Street dealmakers have urged Delaware judges and lawmakers to discourage appraisal, which has been become an investment strategy for hedge funds. Minor Myers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who studies appraisal, called the ruling unusual. Typically, each side presents extreme valuations and the judge finds fair value somewhere in the middle. Instead, Laster took Clearwire's valuation and rejected Aurelius's. I think it's a message to litigants to be sure the arguments they put in front of the court are reasonable, said Myers.The court has been criticized by dealmakers for not deferring to the negotiated deal price when a company ran a proper marketing and sale process. Laster found the Clearwire sale was fair to minority investors, but only after Dish intervened and the price was driven to $5 per share.The Delaware court has ruled in the past year that computer maker Dell Inc and DFC Global Corp, a lender, were both sold below fair value despite properly run mergers.

The pipeline carries gas from the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea to customers in Germany and the Czech Republic. The Luxembourg-based General Court suspended the EU decision in December last year following a challenge by Poland, state-run gas firm PGNiG PGN.WA and PGNiG Supply & Trading. The plaintiffs said Gazprom's increased gas transports via Opal would result in less gas for two other pipelines, threatening Polish gas supply. Court President Marc Jaeger said he was revoking the suspension because there was no proof of serious harm. The applicants have failed to show that the harm suffered as a result of the contested decision is serious and irreparable and therefore that decision remains applicable until delivery of the judgments on its lawfulness, he said. In the light of the average duration of proceedings before the General Court, the judgments on the substance in the present cases will probably be delivered during 2019.Gazprom supplies about a third of Europe's gas needs.Reporting by Foo Yun Chee.

The move is part of the Chinese government's drive to rejuvenate state behemoths with private capital. Beijing added China Unicom last year to a first batch of state-owned enterprises to see mixed-ownership reform. China Unicom, formally known as China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, is one of the world's largest mobile carriers by user numbers, but its recent earnings have struggled in a fiercely competitive market. The carrier is widely seen as over-staffed, inefficient and slow to develop key technologies. It already lags state-owned China Mobile and China Telecom, and private firms have moved ahead in developing cloud and big data services, and mobile software. Reuters reported last month that Alibaba Group Holdings and Tencent Holdings would be among new investors putting a total of about $10 billion into China United Network Communications Ltd, China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit. That total is likely to rise to about 80 billion yuan ($11.8 billion), with Baidu, China's biggest internet search provider, investing about 10 billion yuan ($1.48 billion), and JD.com, the country's second-largest e-commerce company, putting in about 5 billion yuan, one of the people said. The China Unicom unit is likely to raise 15 billion yuan from Tencent and 7 billion yuan from Alibaba, while China Life Investment Holding Co Ltd would be the biggest new investor, with a 20 billion yuan commitment, that person added. Overall, it would be the largest capital raising in the Asia-Pacific region since insurer AIA Group's 2010 initial public offering, according to Thomson Reuters data. The majority of the capital would be raised through new share issues, while China Unicom would also sell part of its stake in the Shanghai unit, the two people said. Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are not public. FILE PHOTO: Company logos of China Unicom are displayed at a news conference during the company's announcement of its annual results in Hong Kong, China March 16, 2016.Bobby Yip/File PhotoBaidu and JD.com declined to comment, and China Unicom, Alibaba and Tencent didn't respond to Reuters requests for comment. China Life Investment Holding could not immediately be reached for comment.China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees state enterprises, also did not respond to requests for comment. 5g Push After the share sale, China Unicom's stake in the Shanghai-listed business would fall to just above 40 percent, from 63 percent currently, one of the sources said, and top investors, including China Life Investment and Tencent, would likely have seats on the firm's board to engage in its operations and improve its management. Both sources said teaming up with China's big tech companies, particularly Tencent and Alibaba, would help revive China Unicom by lowering the cost of attracting new users and shifting its focus from traditional telecoms services to digital information services. The share sale also comes at a time when Beijing is pushing to build the world's largest fifth-generation (5G) mobile network - bringing a significant speed upgrade from today's 4G network. China's 5G market could be worth 1.1 trillion yuan, or 3.2 percent of GDP, by 2025, according to a recent research paper from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The capital raising would give China Unicom the firepower to boost its spending on 5G. Share trading in China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit has been halted since it said in early April it would be part of the government's mixed-ownership pilot. It gave no further details at that time. Prior to that suspension, the unit's market value topped $23 billion. A week ago, the unit said it was waiting for regulatory approvals over details of the mixed-ownership plans, and trading in its shares would remain suspended for another month.

Amazon has long had a presence in Washington, lobbying on a broad range of topics ranging from taxes, immigration, trade and mobile payments. But their decision, announced in June, to buy premium grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion roiled the grocery industry and has sparked some opposition on Capitol Hill and among unions and other Amazon critics.That said, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. Complicating the company's status in the nation's capital, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post - a newspaper that has drawn the public ire of Donald Trump.Candidate Trump famously said in May 2016 that Amazon has a huge antitrust problem. Amazon is on pace to spend more than $12 million this year, if they keep up their lobbying efforts at the same rate. In 2016, the online retailer spent $11 million on lobbying in Washington.The company's lobbying effort more than doubled in 2015 compared with prior years, spending $9 million that year compared with $4.7 million the year before. Amazon added a new firm to the lobbying army in the second quarter of 2017, hiring McGuireWoods Consulting to handle work on drones, among other matters. In addition to consultants, Amazon also employs in-house lobbyists. Their latest filing lists some 15 employees who lobby on behalf of the company on a long list of topics and issues ranging from drone policy to trade regulations and immigration to food stamp programs. Amazon also employs firms to lobby on its behalf on a range of topics. In the second quarter of this year, Amazon paid lobbying megafirm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld $80,000 to lobby, primarily focused on the Marketplace Fairness Act - a bill that would allow state government to collect sales tax from online retailers.

Britain's Paysafe, which offers pre-paid cashcards and online wallets, said separately it was also planning to buy Merchants' Choice Payments Solutions for $470 million, strengthening its presence in the United States. Payments companies have become sought-after targets as more shoppers switch from cash to paying for purchases by smartphone or other mobile devices and a series of deals has driven share prices in the sector higher in recent weeks. Mastercard made the first move last year by buying Britain's Vocalink and deals have picked up in recent weeks. Danish payment services firm Nets A/S said in early July that it had been approached by potential buyers, while days later U.S. credit card processor Vantiv agreed to buy Britain's Worldpay for 7.7 billion pounds to expand outside the United States. That has been followed by a 1.5 billion euro bid on Thursday for Stockholm-based Bambora by France's Ingenico, and, on Friday, news that private equity firm Permira had bought a stake in Sweden's Klarna.

Shares in Paysafe were up 7.4 percent to 582.5 pence a share at 0955 GMT, leading the gainers in Britain's mid-cap index but slightly below the 590 pence per share proposed offer price. If successful, the private equity bid would mark a return to the payments sector for CVC. It previously owned Skrill, a payments company which was bought by Optimal Payments, the AIM-listed forerunner to Paysafe. CVC knows the space extremely well, said a banking source, adding Paysafe had a very positive outlook with some strong growth fundamentals given the drive to go cashless.

Old Mutual on Board Paysafe said that after turning down a number of indicative proposals, it had granted the bidders due diligence access on the basis of the 590 pence per share proposal. The deal is conditional on the buyers being able to sell off Paysafe's Asia Gateway business, with a buyer already lined up, although no further details were given. A source with knowledge of the situation said Blackstone and CVC's experience of a partnership in British group Merlin Entertainments made them a good fit. And a source familiar with CVC's thinking said that Paysafe was potentially a good buy given its current valuation and the consortium's ability to add further value. UBS analyst David Mulholland said the deal value implied a valuation of 14 times Paysafe's estimated 2018 price-to-earnings ratio and 10.4 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Old Mutual Global Investors, Paysafe's largest shareholder with a stake of about 10.3 percent in the group, has signed a non-binding letter of support for the possible offer. Paysafe said its deal for Delta Card Service Inc, the holding company for Houston-based Merchants' Choice Payment Solutions (MCPS), will see Paysafe add around 60,000 clients across 50 states and over $14 billion in sales volume annually. The cash deal will be part-funded by $380 million in bank loans and $90 million from existing cash funds, it added. We would initially highlight that on first impressions the acquisition appears to make sense, (but) is not a particularly high multiple in the context of payments, UBS's Mulholland said in a note to clients, flagging a 'buy' rating.

ACS and Lazard declined to comment, while representatives of JP Morgan and Key Capital Partners were not immediately available to comment. Expansion newspaper reported that ACS had been working on its own offer for weeks and could use its German subsidiary Hochtief (HOTG.DE) to launch the counter-bid. One of the sources said it was too early to say if Hochtief would be part of the deal and there had been no discussions with the German subsidiary. Analysts said that the most likely scenario now is for Atlantia to improve its offer price because the bid undervalues Abertis. ACS's counter-bid makes strategic sense, they said, because Abertis is a low-risk asset that would complement its own operations. The market regulator is still looking at whether to approve Atlantia's bid -- a process that usually takes two or three months -- and the Spanish government can block the transaction if it does not fit with Spain's strategic interests.

There is a deal, NBG's unit will be sold to OTP, a source in Athens said. OTP executives have said publicly they were in the running for Romaneasca as well as other banks in the region as they look to bolster the bank's presence in central Europe. NBG (NBGr.AT) plans to sell more assets in the Balkans, including its Romanian operations, to complete a restructuring plan agreed with European authorities, its chief executive Leonidas Fragiadakis told Reuters this month. This M&A; event was well-anticipated, Ipopema analyst Norbert Harcsa said. OTP could have a 3.6 percent market share (in Romania) versus a management target of 5 percent. The price-to-book could be the same as it was in Croatia (in May). OTP bought Croatian Splitska Banka from Societe Generale for a price close to book value. OTP, which will add Romaneasca's network of about 110 branches, is also expected to pay back a loan of 550 million euros ($625 million) that Banca Romaneasca borrowed from NBG. Apart from Romaneasca, Fragiadakis has said NBG would sell smaller operations in Serbia, Albania and Cyprus as part of agreements with regulators. One asset the bank still has is Serbia's Vojvodanska Banka, which is also a possible target for OTP, which has said it is looking at potential acquisitions there. The Hungarian bank did not reply to questions seeking comment on the Romaneasca deal or any further possible ones. OTP is one of the region's largest independent banks, and weathered the financial crisis better than many rivals. After Hungary imposed special taxes on the financial sector, it took a cautious line, doubling liquidity reserves from 4 billion euros in 2011 to 8.3 billion euros at the end of the first quarter.As those special taxes have been gradually lifted, OTP has begun to expand in the region - just as Greek banks are looking to sell assets. OTP's core equity tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - was 16.6 percent at the end of the first quarter after hovering around 15 percent for the last five years.

The objections indicate that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, is becoming more risk-averse under U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese companies and investors eyeing U.S. assets could face more roadblocks as a result, at a time when the Chinese government is also restricting the flow of capital out of China following a bonanza of Chinese overseas deals.There have been 87 announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese firms so far in 2017, the highest on record and up from 77 deals in the corresponding period in 2016. CFIUS's more conservative stance toward deals coincides with growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. On Wednesday the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Since the start of the year, CFIUS has sent letters to companies involved in at least nine deals to say they would be blocked based on measures they have proposed to address potential national security risks, the people familiar said. Many of these deals are in the technology sector, the sources said. A rise in cyber security threats and rapid advances in technology makes it more difficult to establish whether a deal poses any threat, lawyers who represent companies before CFIUS said. An initial objection by the watchdog does not necessarily kill the deal immediately. Some companies this year have chosen to keep their CFIUS filings alive by proposing new mitigation measures, while others have pulled their applications and canceled their deals, the people said. They asked not be identified because interactions between CFIUS and the companies are confidential. CFIUS decisions are highly sensitive and we are not going to comment on rumors of their outcome, a White House spokeswoman said. A spokesman at the Treasury Department declined to comment. Treasury leads CFIUS with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin serving as chairman. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaks at the U.S. - China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.Yuri GripasMost of the deals that CFIUS has sought to block this year have not been announced. Among the companies that have disclosed they have withdrawn their CFIUS applications and canceled their deals are U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp (INSG.O), which tried to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, and Texas oil producer ExL Petroleum Management LLC, which sought to sell its assets to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Energy. By comparison, in the entirety of 2014, the last year for which CFIUS has released official data, nine deals were withdrawn after CFIUS began an investigation. Several more companies face protracted CFIUS reviews amid delays after Trump took office in filling important mid-level political positions at several of the 16 government departments and agencies that comprise CFIUS.CFIUS is on track to review a record-setting 250 to 300 transactions in 2017, according to Anne Salladin, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP - up sharply from 147 deals in 2014. The backlog is leading many companies that fail to gain CFIUS clearance within the standard 75 days allocated for review to refile their applications. Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. Key Vacancies A number of companies have said in regulatory filings that their high-profile deals are before CFIUS. They include Chinese payments company Ant Financial's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) and China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC's $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O). In addition, investment firm China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra Corp (XCRA.O) are also with the watchdog.Ant Financial has refiled its MoneyGram deal with CFIUS once, while Canyon Bridge and China Oceanwide have refiled their deals twice, according to company disclosures and Reuters reports. Unic is still on its first filing with CFIUS on its Xcerra deal, company disclosures and Reuters reports showed. Of the two dozen political appointee positions in the Treasury Department just three have been confirmed by U.S. lawmakers. A key CFIUS nomination is that of former Allen & Overy LLP lawyer Heath Tarbert, who has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, and has yet to be confirmed.

North America's oldest company, HBC is under pressure from activist investor Jonathan Litt, who disclosed a 4.3 percent stake in the company in June, to get cash from its real estate assets or take action to boost income from them. Initial public offerings of two joint ventures with billions of dollars in U.S., European, and Canadian real estate are unlikely at this point because market conditions are poor, RioCan founder and Chief Executive Edward Sonshine said in an interview in his Toronto office. The retailer formed those ventures in February 2015, one with RioCan, among North America's largest retail REITs, and another with U.S.-based Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N). It said at the time the combined value was C$3.8 billion ($3 billion). The Simon joint venture, HBS Global Properties, has since added investors and European properties. Hudson's Bay spokesman Andrew Blecher declined to comment. But he noted that Hudson's Bay Executive Chairman Richard Baker said in a June 9 earnings conference call that the opportunity to do an IPO was still available, but that conditions had grown tougher in the past six months. Sonshine, a former real estate lawyer whose firm owns 12 percent of the Canadian real estate venture, said an IPO was not realistic. The prevailing narrative is that retail is dead, said Sonshine, who believes otherwise. When the market says that's the prevailing narrative, you can't fight it. Sonshine said Baker had many other options to get cash from HBC's properties, including sale-leasebacks, financing or subleasing. It shouldn't be hard because it's great real estate. Litt had called on HBC's board to consider options including repurposing its real estate, shuttering stores, or taking the company private. HBC said it set up the ventures to pave the way for an IPO or alternative transaction to generate income from their holdings, which include prime real estate in Canada and the United States. RioCan, founded in 1993, focuses on major urban markets and has been reducing holdings in low-growth markets and diversifying its tenants.

They were designed to withstand the three-year downturn in commodities that has crushed profits at companies that buy, sell and process grains and oilseeds.We believe that management wanted to assure investors that the company does not need to be acquired, that it can deliver these savings that might have been synergies, said Ann Duignan, analyst at J.P. Morgan. Also, it can deliver them on its own and increase returns to shareholders without needing to be acquired. I believe that this plan buys management time.Bunge, the smallest of the listed global grains traders, rebuffed a takeover bid from Glencore PLC in May. In its restructuring announcement, seen as a defense against both Glencore and activist investor Carlson Capital, Bunge also warned that its second quarter profit would fall below the low end of a range of analyst estimates. Multi-strategy hedge fund Carlson Capital has occasionally taken activist positions. It owned 1.75 million Bunge shares as of the last quarter, according to securities filings, making it the 15th largest shareholder with a stake worth 1.24 percent of the company.Certain segments of the grain industry were ripe for consolidation, Bunge Chief Executive Soren Schroder said. The way we have gone about this over the last couple of years and continue to pursue is really by forming regional alliances with companies that can see the benefit of joining forces, he said on a conference call with analysts. I think there are more opportunities like that that we can explore over time. Schroder reiterated that Bunge wanted to be a leader in such alliances and joint ventures. He declined to comment further on industry consolidation. Glencore declined to comment on the possibility of a fresh bid for Bunge.Bunge's shares rose 89 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $79.58 on Thursday.

Spirit is considering placing some of its retail properties, including those they lease to Shopko, into a new REIT that would then be spun off, potentially at a valuation of more than $1 billion, the sources said on Thursday.Spirit would manage the new REIT to help hold down administrative costs, the people added.The discussions are still in early stages, and Spirit may decide against pursuing the spin, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private.Spirit and Shopko did not respond to requests for comment.Earlier this year, Spirit said it was reviewing strategic alternatives after reporting disappointing earnings, largely the result of its retail tenants failing to pay rents. Shopko is Spirit's largest tenant as a percentage of rental revenue, according to Spirit's financial statements.The dramatic and swift moving changes to the retail landscape in reaction to changing consumer behavior has been well documented, said Thomas Nolan, who stepped down as Spirit chief executive in May.I will say the impacts are profound, and they do impact Spirit Realty. Jackson Hsieh, Spirit's former president and chief operating officer, replaced Nolan. Hsieh remains president.Retail bankruptcies have shaken landlords, who face a growing number of empty storefronts and declining rents in their malls and strip centers. Payless ShoeSource, children's clothier Gymboree and teen retailers Wet Seal and American Apparel are among the chains that have shuttered hundreds of stores as part of their bankruptcies. Shopko operates over 380 stores in 26 states throughout the Central, Western and Pacific Northwest regions. It is owned by private equity firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. REITs frequently spin off properties to streamline their portfolios and increase their appeal to investors, who often prefer a REIT to focus on a single type of real estate.Earlier this week, office and retail REIT Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N) completed a spin-off of its Washington D.C.-based real estate into a separately traded REIT called JBG Smith Properties (JBGS.N). Last year, healthcare REIT HCP Inc (HCP.N) completed a spin off of its skilled nursing and assisted living properties into a separate REIT, Quality Care Properties Inc (QCP.N).

The stock market listing could be the largest private equity-backed initial public offering since hotel company Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) went public with a $19.7 billion valuation in 2013. It would be a quick turnaround for Apollo, which bought ADT for roughly $7 billion in 2016 and merged it with Protection 1, a smaller U.S. peer it had previously acquired. The combined company was valued at $15 billion, including debt, Apollo said at the time.Boca Raton, Florida-based ADT could register for the IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the fall and go public at the end of 2018, one of the sources said, cautioning the timing could change. The sources requested anonymity because the IPO plans, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are confidential. Private equity firms tend to use a lot of debt to finance acquisitions. In recent years, IPO returns from these investments have thinned as investors worry about debt risk. So far this year, private equity backed companies have raised $5.9 billion in public offerings, down 30 percent from the same period in 2015 and 70 percent in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Last year, the total was $3.4 billion in what was a particularly slow year for IPOs across the board.The largest private equity backed IPO so far this year was from industrial machinery maker Gardner Denver Holdings Inc (GDI.N), which began trading with a market capitalization of roughly $4 billion. ADT is expected to have total 2017 revenue of about $4.0 billion, which is growing at a pace of roughly 2 percent, according to credit rating agency Moody's. Apollo acquired ADT as the credit markets tightened. To help fund it, Apollo and its co-investors agreed to provide $4.5 billion for the deal, a big equity check by leveraged buyout industry standards. ADT started in 1874 as the American District Telegraph Company. It evolved into an alert box company and more recently has added on automation features that allow home video surveillance and remote locking and unlocking of doors.

Slideshow (2 Images)Still, shares in its Brazilian unit fell as much as 4.3 percent in Thursday trading before paring losses to 0.5 percent, at 14.92 reais in late afternoon trading. The stock had priced at the 15 reais floor of a suggested price range in a deal that raised 5.12 billion reais ($1.6 billion). At that level, it would trade at similar multiples to rival GPA SA (PCAR4.SA), which it recently surpassed as Brazil's largest supermarket chain. Carrefour overestimated the market's appetite for its shares, said Marcelo Garbes, head of equity trading at brokerage Tullet Prebon. Analysts said Carrefour Brasil lacks a substantial competitive advantage to its rival that would justify higher share prices. Market share at GPA's food and staples division increased in the second quarter, though Carrefour Brasil has shown consistently higher profit margins. In a Wednesday note to clients, analysts at UBS Securities set a sell recommendation on the stock, citing concerns that the company may be unable to compete on price.

Etihad, which held a 33.33 percent stake in Darwin Airline, and other investors have sold their shares to a new Swiss subsidiary of Slovenia's Adria Airways, according to a Darwin Airline statement on Thursday. An Adria Airways spokeswoman told Reuters it had bought 99.1 percent of Darwin Airline and would purchase the remaining shares shortly. Darwin Airline was one of eight carriers Etihad bought since 2011 and the second one sold after British Airways-owner International Airlines Group (IAG) (ICAG.L) took over Aer Lingus [AERLI.UL] in 2015. Darwin Airline will be rebranded as Adria Airways Switzerland. It has operated as Etihad Regional since 2014 when Etihad Airways bought its stake. The value of the transaction was not disclosed. The shares were sold to a new Swiss subsidiary of Adria Airways, the statement said. Adria Airways Chief Financial Officer Heinrich Ollendiek will replace Maurizio Merlo as Darwin Airline chief executive officer. Etihad' minority stakes, which include holdings in Italy's Alitalia and Germany's Air Berlin (AB1.DE), were already in doubt after the Gulf carrier began a strategy review last year. Etihad sold its stake in Darwin Airline as part of the continuing review, Etihad's chief strategy and planning officer Kevin Knight said. Etihad appointed Irishman Ray Gammell as interim chief executive in May, replacing Hogan who left Etihad on July 1. Etihad has spent billions of dollars buying minority stakes from Europe to Australia in its bid to catch up with regional rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways. Hogan had championed the strategy, arguing it provided scale for Etihad, the youngest of the three major Middle East carriers. Etihad's strategy has allowed it to cut costs by pooling items such as aircraft procurement, while offering a larger network. It says it brings together 600 destinations and over 700 aircraft. The future of those investments is unclear amid the review and after staff at Alitalia overwhelmingly rejected its latest restructuring plans in April. Air Berlin saw its losses widen to a record 782 million euros in 2016. Other investments such as Air Serbia and Air Seychelles have been more successful. In those carriers, Etihad was given hands-on management control and benefited from close diplomatic ties.

Shanghai Pharmaceutical Holding Co Ltd, China Resources Pharmaceutical Group Ltd and Sinopharm Group Co Ltd are among those wanting to buy Cardinal Health China, one of the nation's largest drug distributors, said the first source who had direct knowledge of the matter. A second source confirmed the sale process. Cardinal wants to exit over worries China's upcoming drug distribution reform could slow its growth, according to the first source. The Ohio-based company has also been diversifying, and in April announced a $6.1 billion deal for Medtronic Plc's medical supplies units. It has hired Lazard as an adviser for the China sale, according to the sources. The first round of bidding is due around Friday, said the first source. Cardinal's China business, which operates 16 distribution centers in 20 cities, generated over $3.5 billion in revenue last year, compared to over $3 billion in 2015, according to its earnings report. The U.S. company could fetch a price in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, said the first source. Cardinal, Shanghai Pharma and CR Pharma declined to comment while Sinopharm and Lazard didn't respond to Reuters's request for comment. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are not public. The planned sale comes after Beijing in January introduced a so-called two-invoice procurement system for drug distribution on a trial basis, as part of a broader overhaul of the country's fragmented, disorganized healthcare sector.China has for over a decade been considering streamlining its multi-layered drug distribution system which profits intermediaries and drives up drug prices. A stand of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Holding Co Ltd is seen at a medicine exhibition in Shanghai, China June 26, 2012.StringerUnder the new mechanism, which is expected to be fully implemented in 2018, drug manufacturers can only work with a single distributor which directly supplies products to healthcare facilities such as hospitals.The overhaul is expected by industry insiders and analysts to reshape China's drug distribution landscape, with distributors that lack links to strong manufacturers and healthcare facilities liable to be cut out of the supply chain.The new policy is likely to squeeze margins for most distributors in China. They will be under pressure for future profitability, said the first source. It does make Cardinal and others worried. FILE PHOTO: The company logo of Sinopharm Group Co Ltd is displayed at a news conference on the company's annual results in Hong Kong, China March 29, 2016.Bobby Yip/File PhotoThe source added that while the move will also impact state-owned pharma firms, strong backing from Beijing to create national champions in key industries and post-deal synergy gains still make the target appealing to them. The state-owned pharma firms have been looking to expand. Shanghai Pharma, backed by the Shanghai government, said in May it may bid for German generic drugmaker Stada, but Reuters later reported it had failed to reach an agreement with a bidding consortium.CR Pharma, a unit of state-backed conglomerate China Resources Holdings, manufactures and distributes drugs in China under well-know brands, including 999. It raised about $1.8 billion through its Hong Kong listing late last year, which helped replenish its coffers. In 2010, Cardinal became the first major U.S. wholesaler to invest in China's drug distribution market with its $470 million takeover of privately held Zuellig Pharma China, known locally as Yong Yu, the largest pharma importer in the country.Cardinal has since acquired several other Chinese distributors and rebranded the whole business as Cardinal Health China.

Importantly for Wanda, it removes a 30 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) loan the conglomerate had planned to extend to Sunac to finance the deal and will see Wanda pocket funds from the sale by end-January at the latest, rather than waiting three years for the loan to be repaid. The main difference in the revised deal is that Wanda no longer needs to loan money to Sunac which is beneficial to its cashflow, said Franco Leung, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. Investors in R&F; and Sunac also cheered the new deal, sending their stocks to record highs. R&F;, which said the deal would make it the largest hotel owner in the world, saw its shares jump as much as 13 percent on Thursday while Sunac climbed as high as 18 percent. And at Wednesday's new conference, Wang was also quick to stress how much stronger Wanda's commercial property unit would be once the deal was completed, saying we have decided to pay off most of our bank loans. By the end of the year, Wanda Commercial will own 33 million square meters of commercial properties with rent surpassing 33 billion yuan in 2018, he said, adding that the unit will have an annual rent growth rate of about 20 percent for the coming five years. Is Wanda Commercial running a good business? You can make your own judgment, he said.

Initial payments are a lot less, with Ablynx receiving an upfront payment of 23 million euros and 8 million in research funding, but big milestones will kick in if any of the experimental projects achieve commercial success. The deal gives Sanofi access to a total of eight of Ablynx's so-called nanobody medicines, which are derived from camel and llama antibodies. The focus is on developing products to treat immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, the companies said. Shares in Ablynx rose more than 6 percent in early trading on news of the tie-up. For Sanofi, the deal expands the company's drug discovery efforts in immunology at a time when it is launching a promising new treatment for severe eczema.

Silver Lake, which has controlled Global Blue since 2012, is expected to select banks later this year with a view to floating the business in the first half of next year, the sources said. Several banks have pitched for an initial public offering (IPO) mandate at Silver Lake's London offices this week, the sources said, adding the process was still at an early stage. Silver Lake would expect an IPO to value Global Blue at more than 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion), sources close to the firm said. Reuters reported last year that Silver Lake and Partners Group, which has a minority stake in the business, had started sounding out possible bidders and had signed non-disclosure agreements with a series of interested parties. Now, the sources said, Silver Lake is looking to press ahead with an IPO in the first half of 2018 but has yet to decide where to list the company. The U.S. buyout fund sees an IPO as its preferred option, the sources said. It has no plans to launch a sales process, said one of them. A sale of the company would fetch up to 3 billion euros ($3.46 billion), bankers have said. Global Blue serves tourists who buy luxury goods while abroad. It has been backed by private equity investors for the past nine years, with Silver Lake and Partners Group being the latest funds to come onboard in 2012. The business relies on Chinese, Middle Eastern and Russian tourists who use its network to purchase goods tax free, and as such has drawn interest from Asian buyers seeking access to European markets, the sources said. Chinese conglomerate HNA Group is one of the interested parties evaluating the business, which operates in 51 countries across the world and employs about 1,800 people, another source said. HNA, which declined to comment for this story, bought 16.79 percent of Swiss airport duty-free retailer Dufry AG (DUFN.S) in April and remains interested in scouting out assets that cater to the growing number of Chinese traveling overseas, sources familiar with the company said. Private equity funds, including Warburg Pincus, have also looked at Global Blue, the sources said. Warburg Pincus declined to comment. Silver Lake has not engaged in any direct talks with HNA or Warburg Pincus, the sources close to Silver Lake said. Global Blue reported 115 million euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the year ending March 2015, representing a 13 percent drop on the previous year, a report by Moody's Investors Service said.In a more recent February 2017 ratings update, Moody's noted the company had a strong operating performance, with net revenues up 3 percent in first nine months to 31 December 2016 and EBITDA up 14 percent during the same period. In a statement last year, the company said 2016 was a turbulent year for the tax-free shopping industry due to factors such as militant attacks and currency fluctuations. Without disclosing any financial figure, the statement said Global Blue's tax-free shopping sales were hit hard at the start of the year but stabilized in the last quarter of 2016, growing 3 percent in December.

Bunge, the smallest of the listed global grains traders, rebuffed a bid from Glencore in May but its admission on Wednesday that second quarter earnings would disappoint has opened up the possibility that Glencore might make another approach, analysts said. To the extent that they underperform expectations, it's more likely that someone will look to acquire them or do some sort of transaction with them, John Rogers, senior vice president at Moody's, told Reuters. If Glencore, whose market capitalization is more than five times Bunge's $11 billion, does make a second attempt and is successful, it would be the industry's largest shake-up in decades and redraw the global food supply chain. The Glencore bid has made companies across the agribusiness space look at their assets in a new light, with a focus on return on invested capital, said Farha Aslam, analyst with Stephens Inc. Global grains trading has long been dominated by Bunge and its three main rivals - Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Corp. - who typically make money by buying crops locally from farmers and shifting them to global buyers. They own capital-intensive assets like warehouses, ships, barges and processing plants. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the last four years as bumper harvests have kept grain prices low and crimped trading profits. The big four traders - known as the ABCDs - have taken steps to diversify, selling underperforming assets and buying businesses which offer higher margins. Stepping Up Pace Glencore's move has stepped up the push for change and could herald a shake-up similar to the transformation of the agrichemicals industry, where six leading players are merging into three giants in deals totaling around $240 billion. Dow Chemical Co and DuPont are merging, China's ChemChina will buy Syngenta AG and Bayer AG has snapped up Monsanto Co. It was Bunge's own chief executive, Soren Schroder, who in May suggested consolidation among the grain traders was coming - and even said his company could lead it. Glencore, best known in metals and energy trading, has so far been one of the most active players, setting its sights on expanding its agricultural commodities business. It pursued Louis Dreyfus' grains business in recent years, but failed to strike a deal. The ABCDs are also facing stiffer competition from players such as China's COFCO Group, which recently scooped up the agribusiness of Singapore-listed Noble Group and Dutch grain trader Nidera, and Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp, which bought U.S. grain handler Gavilon in 2012. COFCO, however, is likely to sit out the industry consolidation as it integrates recent acquisitions. Privately-held Cargill, the C of the big four, is two years into a restructuring and confident it can take part in the shake-up to come. It launched a restructuring effort in late 2015 and has already sold $700 million of assets and made strategic investments of $1 billion, including fish feeding andchocolate. Its latest quarterly profit was sharply higher than a year ago, suggesting the changes are bearing fruit. If our profitability continues to perform well, we just create more room for acquisitions, Marcel Smits, Cargill's chief financial officer told Reuters.

Lee Partners, for $12.3 billion in 2007. Univision filed for an IPO in 2015, but investor appetite for large indebted companies such as Univision soured and those plans have been on hold.During the delay, the company underwent a restructuring that led to the layoffs of more than 200 employees. It also acquired U.S. internet publisher Gawker Media LLC for $135 million. Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) is a minority investor in Univision.

Bunge, which was targeted for a possible takeover by commodities trader Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) in May, said it would cut capital expenditure targets for 2018 and 2019 and that its second-quarter profit would fall below the range of analysts' estimates. Massive global grain stockpiles and low prices following four years of bumper harvests around the world have dragged down profits for Bunge and other global grains traders, including rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N), Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co. The companies, known as the ABCDs of grain trading, have tried to diversify away from commodities trading through asset sales and buying higher-value businesses like flavorings and natural ingredients. Current fundamentals in the ag cycle are challenging, so companies are increasingly focusing on reducing costs, said Farha Aslam, food and agribusiness analyst with Stephens Inc. But while the new initiatives have begun to generate some stronger results, a downturn in commodities markets has more than offset the gains and mergers are now being touted as an option. Bunge's chief executive, Soren Schroder, said in May that his company could lead consolidation. Bunge expects its latest plans would reduce overhead costs by $250 million once the plan is fully implemented by the end of 2019. The company will give detailed second-quarter results on Aug. 2, one day after ADM reports its earnings. Limited farmer sales of crops in South America, home to a large share of Bunge's elevators and processing plants, squeezed margins for the company's agribusiness division, its largest in terms of revenue. Farmers are holding back supplies in the hope of better prices for their crops. Market conditions during the second quarter were challenging, driven by unprecedented farmer retention in South America, which pressured margins throughout the chain, Chief Executive Soren Schroder said in a statement. It would be Bunge's second consecutive weak quarter after first-quarter profit fell 82 percent. Bunge said it expects stronger results in the second half of 2017. The company scheduled a conference call to discuss the plan on Thursday at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). Bunge shares fell 3.4 percent to $76.00 in after-hours trade.

In 2008, Borealis acquired then-publicly listed Teranet Income Fund for about C$1.5 billion. Teranet Income Fund was spun off by the Ontario government in 2003. Toronto-based Teranet, which has exclusive rights to offer electronic land registration services in Ontario and Manitoba, collects a fee every time a home in Canada's most populous province and its Western neighbor changes hands or is registered.It also offers housing data services. Its Teranet-National Bank (NA.TO) house price index, a collaboration with Canada's sixth biggest bank, is a closely tracked economic indicator. OMERS, Carlyle and KKR all declined to comment. There is no certainty that a deal will materialize, the sources said, adding that OMERS could also choose to keep the asset. It was also not immediately clear if OMERS is running a formal sales process involving investment banks. Teranet has benefited from the boom in Canada's housing market, the people said. Canadian housing market prices soared over the past decade, with Ontario, home to capital city Ottawa and business center Toronto, in particular seeing strong demand from foreign buyers. For example, Toronto prices rose 29.3 percent in the year to June 30, and have more than doubled since 2009. The move by OMERS to consider offloading Teranet suggests that the pension fund believes it may be time to sell and take the returns when the market might be close to the top. In April, the province of Ontario said it would introduce a property tax for foreign buyers in order to cool Toronto's housing market. Concerns of a housing bubble have drawn warnings from both the Bank of Canada and the International Monetary Fund.

London-listed Reckitt said in April it was reviewing options for the unit, which includes French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce, to cut debt following its $16.6 billion purchase of baby formula maker Mead Johnson. The sale, announced late on Tuesday, will reduce Reckitt's net debt to EBITDA ratio to 3.3 times from 4.1 times. It will enable it to focus more closely on its consumer health and home brands, which include Durex condoms and Mucinex cold medicine. McCormick, maker of Lawry's, Old Bay and Billy Bee honey, will gain a leading position in the U.S. condiments category. Still, the company's shares fell more than 5 percent to a six-month low.At $4.2 billion, the price represents a multiple of 19.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. According to Bernstein analysts, that is much higher than the long-term average of major deals in the sector, which is 16.2 times earnings. It is also higher than the 18 times earnings multiple that Reckitt paid for Mead Johnson.This seems pricey for a business that has only been growing sales at 3-5 percent in recent years, and that already has a very high (28.7 percent) EBIT margin,” Bernstein said, implying that cost savings may elusive.Sources had estimated that the business, which attracted interest from several strategic U.S. players, would fetch more than $3 billion.

Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said in March that America Movil, controlled by the Slim family, must separate part of its network infrastructure into a new entity. The move ratcheted up antitrust measures against America Movil, which has long been dominant in Mexico and is Latin America's largest telecommunications company by number of subscribers.Talks between America Movil and regulators on the details of the separation are ongoing, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a conference call after company's second-quarter results, but he said a deal could be hashed out as soon as the fourth quarter of 2017 or during the first three months next year. Hajj said the discussions have not touched on whether America Movil will be granted a license to offer pay television in Mexico, something the company has long sought. America Movil has also become Latin America's biggest pay TV provider. Mexico is the only place where there is a limitation, Hajj said. It doesn’t make any sense. The restriction creates an imbalance between America Movil and competitors such as Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), which can sell bundles of landline, Internet and TV service to consumers, analysts said. What they are arguing is that because they already opened up their network for competitors, then the market should open up for them, said Carlos de Legarreta, an analyst at GBM. In addition, the Supreme Court is considering whether to wipe away parts of a 2013 reform of the telecom sector that tilted the playing field against America Movil. A ruling could come as soon as August.America Movil's lawyers maintain that legislators did not have the right to create asymmetrical rules meant to help smaller players. Nevertheless, America Movil's recent performance suggests the company has adjusted to the new regulatory landscape, analysts said. On Tuesday, America Movil reported that its net profit climbed 86 percent to 14.3 billion pesos in its second quarter, buoyed by the peso's recent rally.The results in general are positive, said Intercam analyst Alik Garcia.

Fox executive chairman Lachlan and chief executive James said the deal was one of the biggest investments in Britain since the country voted to leave the European Union last year. The Sky News logo is seen on the outside of offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017.Toby MelvilleOur proposed transaction will be carefully scrutinized by others keen to gauge the government's commitment to creating a climate conducive to investment, or in the words of the Prime Minister and several of your fellow ministers, 'open for business', they told Bradley. Regulator Ofcom has assessed the deal and found it had no concerns about Fox's genuine commitment to broadcasting standards, a view Bradley said she was minded to endorse. But it was worried about the level of influence the deal could give the Murdoch family over Britain's news agenda and political process, and said it should be referred to a lengthy review, which could push a final decision well into 2018. Fox said it was disappointed by Bradley's intention to refer the deal, although she still has to confirm her decision after receiving further submissions. The Murdoch family, led by 86-year-old Rupert, has long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal. The family's Fox offered $14.6 billion to buy the 61 percent of Britain's Sky it does not already own in December, re-igniting a debate about their political influence.

The antibiotics business under strategic review covers the brands Zinnat/Ceftin, Zinacef and Fortum and has worldwide annual sales estimated at around 200 million pounds ($260 million), but it faces growing competition from cheap generics. In addition, GSK announced just over 300 job losses on Wednesday and confirmed that the UK-focused MaxiNutrition sports nutrition brand would be sold. The combined annual UK sales of Horlicks and MaxiNutrition, which industry sources had previously said were on the block, are around 30 million pounds. GSK is also exploring options to divest some other smaller non-core nutrition brands. The moves show new Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley putting her mark on Britain's biggest drugmaker as she tries to simplify operations, improve operating efficiencies and focus on priority areas. She will outline her wider vision for GSK alongside half-year results next week. The company said in a statement that none of the changes had been taken as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. Although GSK will continue to make other antibiotics, such as Augmentin, and will conduct research into new medicines to fight so-called superbug infections, it will no longer need as many factories. As a result, it has decided not to proceed with a previously planned 350 million pounds investment to build a new facility in Ulverston, northern England, and it will outsource some manufacturing work at its Worthing site on the south coast. The cuts at Worthing and at a factory in Slough, where Horlicks is made, will result in around 320 job losses over the next four years. Overall, GSK employs 17,000 staff in Britain, with 5,000 in manufacturing, and it plans to invest more than 140 million pounds at other UK sites between now and 2020. In Britain, where Horlicks is sold as a bedtime drink, the product has largely fallen out of favor and sales are very limited. Indian demand for Horlicks, by contrast, is strong and GSK has developed the malted barley milk drink into its top consumer brand in the country. Selling both MaxiNutrition, which GSK bought for 162 million pounds ($210 million) in 2010, and the British arm of Horlicks, which is an even smaller business, will not move the dial at the drugmaker, given its market value of 79 billion pounds. Horlicks is more than 140 years old with origins dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, first founded a company in Chicago to manufacture the drink.

Investments funds led by Elliott Management have engaged in a feud with Ansaldo STS's controlling shareholder Hitachi (6501.T) since the Japanese company bought the company in 2015, challenging the price paid as well as governance and strategy.Owned by U.S. hedge fund manager Paul Singer, Elliott is vocal in many board rooms at European and U.S. companies, including Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) and Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton (BLT.L), where it has built sizeable stakes and waged lengthy battles. It is the second biggest shareholder in Ansaldo STS, with a 22.5 percent stake, an option to buy a further 8.8 percent, andthree board seats. Chief Executive Andrew Barr told Reuters the tug-of-war with Elliott had hampered the group's decision-making but said it needed to press on with business. There is still growth in the market, but we see that it is slowing down so we are also looking at ... small acquisitions, he said late on Tuesday. There is nothing concrete at the moment but we are looking hard across sectors. Barr, who has been at the helm of the group for just over a year, confirmed the group's guidance for 2017, with new orders of between 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.7-2.3 billion) and revenues between 1.35-1.45 billion euros. In the first quarter, new orders stood at 266 million euros, down 14 percent year-on-year. The Genoa-based group, is vying for big contracts in Baltimore and Riyadh, after orders in the first three months were smaller than expected.Uncertain Horizon FILE PHOTO: Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management Corporation, speaks at WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 25, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoHitachi bought 40 percent of Ansaldo STS from Italian defense conglomerate Leonardo (LDOF.MI).It later raised its stake to 51 percent through a mandatory buyout of minorities but failed to reach the threshold required to delist Ansaldo STS and fold it into its own operations.Elliott said the bid price was too low, triggering several complaints to the market regulator and a lawsuit which is now before the European Court of Justice.Elliott says Hitachi underpaid by colluding with the seller, an allegation both Hitachi and Leonardo have denied. It has also questioned the independence of Ansaldo STS's board, opening a dedicated website to list its grievances.In one of the latest clashes, Hitachi in May scrapped a dividend payout already approved by the board after Elliott requested it to be raised. Barr said the stalemate would not be resolved anytime soon.One of the reasons I have been going around the world and meeting staff is to give them some reassurance that we are in a position to focus on the future of the company, the 44-year old executive said. (The row) does affect us, because we are constantly planning to a horizon that we don't know where it is.With funds Amber and Litespeed, which hold a combined stake of over 6 percent, Elliott could veto any extraordinary operations proposed in shareholding meetings. The main message to the staff has been: let's get on and deliver, let's look at the planning for the future with an eye on continuing with the company as it is, and one eye with whenever the integration (with Hitachi) happens.

Chinese banks were told to stop funding several of Wanda's overseas acquisitions, sources said on Monday, unnerving investors and hitting shares in companies seen as potential targets in the clampdown. Shares in retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd (002024.SZ) tumbled on Wednesday after the state broadcaster cited its 270 million euro ($311 million) purchase of Italy's Inter Milan soccer club last year during a show about what it called irrational overseas deals. Foreign firms that were bought by Wanda have sought to soothe concerns that their businesses could take a knock. Wanda-owned cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) and Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment said on Tuesday they were insulated from the Chinese regulator's curbs. Shares in AMC, bought by Wanda for $2.6 billion in 2012, fell 10 percent on Monday, although they recovered slightly on Tuesday. China's state planner said on Tuesday it aimed to curb irrational foreign investment in the drive that started last year and focused on deals in real estate, entertainment and sport. China is also cracking down on risky lending before this years key Communist Party congress. Wanda, led by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin, is among several Chinese firms that have expanded overseas in areas beyond their original business. Wang defended his firm on Wednesday at an event to announce details of the sale of some theme parks and hotels. I really can't see what benefit there is for those people who have recently been spreading rumors to harm Wanda, he said. Investor Jitters AMC said in a statement on Tuesday that four deals to buy cinema chains completed between 2015 and 2017 year were fully paid for by its own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks. At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theater purchases, AMC said, adding it had never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose. Legendary, bought by Wanda last year for about $3.5 billion, said it was well capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates and operate its business as usual. Investor nervousness has extended beyond Wanda and its units. Suning's shares wobbled when the state CCTV show cited its purchase of Inter Milan as an example of risky overseas deals. The CCTV show also mentioned property developer Sunac China (1918.HK), which has made a series of large investments over the last year, and referred to a deal by a Chinese consortium to buy Italian soccer club AC Milan this year. Suning's vice chairman Sun Weimin told local media his firm strongly supported Chinese policies on overseas investment and said the firm's push overseas was to bolster its market back home. Suning declined to comment further. Curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focus on six deals abroad where lenders have been told not to provide finance or not to allow Wanda to use offshore assets as collateral for financing, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed.Wanda, a major property developer, has been reining in some of its more ambitious undertakings. It said on Wednesday it would sell 77 hotels to Guangzhou R&F; Properties (2777.HK) for 19.9 billion yuan ($2.95 billion), altering terms of an agreement announced last week. It will also sell 91 percent of 13 cultural projects to Sunac for 43.8 billion yuan, up from 29.58 billion yuan.

The California Court of Appeal issued the temporary stay of the restraining order based only on a brief submitted by Toshiba, and without consideration of Western Digital's opposition filing, the U.S. company said. The next hearing on this case has been set for July 28 in the Superior Court of California. Western Digital has also sought an injunction to block the planned chip-business transaction, arguing that any sale required its consent. On July 14, the Superior Court of California postponed a decision on Western Digital's injunction request and proposed requiring Toshiba to give the U.S. company two weeks notice before closing the sale.

Stada said on July 10 that Bain and Cinven would raise their offer by 25 cents per share to 66.25 euros after their previous 5.3 billion euro ($6.1 billion) bid fell through. The private equity groups are also lowering their acceptance threshold to 63 percent, after the last offer secured the support of 65.52 percent of shareholders, short of the 67.5 percent they had targeted. The newest offer is the latest twist in a takeover saga for Stada - one of the last remaining independent generic drugmakers in Europe - that has seen management upheaval and previous failed offers. Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned this month after the failure of the most recent bid. Bain and Cinven said on Wednesday they had already received irrevocable commitments to their sweetened bid from shareholders representing about 19.6 percent of Stada's stock. Stada said its boards would examine the new offer document and issue a reasoned statement in a timely manner. As of today, both boards expect to be able to recommend the renewed offer for acceptance to the shareholders, it said. Labor union IG BCE has meanwhile threatened to resist any further takeover attempts if Bain and Cinven's fresh offer fails. This is some high-level gambling, and Stada's employees will have to foot the bill later, Ralf Erkens, district chief at the union, said in a recent statement.

Shares in Evergrande rallied to a record high last month, as the country's top property developer unveiled a plan to redeem all of its perpetual bonds to lower leverage and interest costs ahead of an imminent backdoor listing for most of its real estate assets in mainland China. Chinese Estates is optimistic about China Evergrande's overall prospect, the company said in a statement.

The deal includes seed processing plants and seed research centers, a copy of Dow AgroSciences' Brazilian corn germplasm bank, the Morgan seed brand and a license for the use of the Dow Sementes brand for a certain period of time, Dow said on Tuesday.The assets, which generated revenue of about $287 million in 2016, are being sold by Dow to meet conditions set by Brazilianantitrust regulators for its $130 billion merger with DuPont. The deal will boost China's share of the global seed business, which is being remade by a series of huge mergers. These include the $43 billion takeover of Swiss firm Syngenta by state-owned Chemchina in China's largest foreign takeover. Chemchina said recently it is looking to snap up seed assets that rival Bayer must sell to gain regulatory approval for its takeover of Monsanto. CITIC Agri Fund was founded in 2016 by CITIC Agriculture, a division of state-backed CITIC Ltd, along with Chinese seed firm Yuan Longping High-Tech Co Ltd (000998.SZ) and two other listed agricultural companies, according to CITIC Ltd's 2016 annual report. CITIC Ltd, China's largest conglomerate with interests in financial services to real estate and heavy industry, could not immediately be reached for comment. The company made its first foray into the seed business in 2014, buying a majority stake in Yuan Longping High-Tech, one of China's leading breeders of hybrid rice. Yuan Longping High-Tech said that year that it wanted to become one of the world's top five seed companies. Dow and DuPont (DD.N) announced the all-stock merger in December 2015. The two companies won U.S. antitrust approval last month to merge on condition that they sell certain crop protection products and other assets. The European Union also cleared their merger in March.Dow reaffirmed that the merger deal was expected to close next month, with the intended spin-offs to occur within 18 months of closing. The companies have said that they would split into three separate companies specializing in material sciences, specialty products, and seeds and agrochemicals upon completion of the merger.

SLS Management LLC said Abercrombie was not being aggressive enough in efforts to turn itself around amid falling sales at most of its brands. SLS owned 0.84 percent of Abercrombie's shares outstanding as of March 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie operates around 700 stores in the United States and nearly 200 more internationally. SLS, in a letter to the company's board, laid out two ways for Abercrombie to buy back shares. The retailer could buy back $200 million of stock while slashing its annual dividend to 18 cents from the current 80 cents, SLS said. Alternatively, Abercrombie could sell its real estate assets that make up a substantial portion of its market value and use the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares, the investor added. A repurchase of almost 30 percent of Abercrombie's shares would be an important illustration of management's confidence in the turnaround and the attractiveness of the stock at current prices, SLS said. A spokeswoman for Abercrombie said the company maintains open dialogue with and regularly considers the views of its shareholders, including SLS Management. Abercrombie last week ended talks over a potential sale, dealing another blow to the retail sector that has struggled to cope with low mall traffic and changing consumer tastes. It had announced in May it was in preliminary discussions with several parties regarding a potential transaction, after having received expressions of interest.Abercrombie received interest from both private equity firms and other retailers, a source familiar with the situation said, requesting anonymity because the conversations were confidential.Mergers and acquisitions in the retail sector are difficult because cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design, and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor. Retailers including Aeropostale, Wet Seal and BCBG Max Azria Group LLC have filed for bankruptcy over the past two years. Shares of Abercrombie were up 2.3 percent at $9.49 in after-hours trading.

Reuters had reported the pricing earlier in the day citing sources familiar with the matter.Carrefour Brasil, a unit of France's Carrefour SA (CARR.PA) and Brazil's largest supermarket chain, and shareholders secured 5.12 billion reais ($1.6 billion) with the transaction. Carrefour Brasil sold 91.2 million shares in so-called secondary offering, in which current shareholders sell part of their stakes, and 205.8 million shares in primary offering, in which the proceeds go to the company's coffers. At 15 reais per shares, Carrefour Brasil will trade at a discount against rival GPA SA (PCAR4.SA) in terms of enterprise value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a metric known as EV/EBITDA. Other multiples, such as sales over EBITDA, yield a premium for Carrefour Brazil. Investors were reluctant to bid at the top half of the 15-19 reais suggested range for a company that lacks a substantial competitive advantage, fund managers said. Still, the IPO should help Carrefour Brasil add muscle to take on GPA, whose food division has recovered amid slowing appliance sales.

If it decides to go ahead with the idea, BP said it would register the subsidiary by year-end.The company and its underwriters have retained advisors to explore the sale, the source said.A spinoff likely would be one of the larger initial public offerings of the year, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the talks were private.BP did not comment on the details or potential valuation of a possible transaction beyond the press release. It would own the MLP's general partner and receive all of its distribution rights, the statement said. Several other energy companies have spun off their pipeline assets to generate capital. They include rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), which in 2014 raised nearly $1 billion in the largest MLP IPO to date, along with refiners like Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), Tesoro Corp (TSO.N), and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N). Shell was the first oil major to use this structure to generate cash from its assets. Shell's partnership has a market value of about $5.38 billion. BP's pipeline network is slightly smaller than Shell's.Previous efforts by BP to sell pipeline assets have not materialized. Last year, BP approached Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) to sell some of BP's offshore Gulf of Mexico pipeline network, but the deal fell through, according to a person familiar with that transaction.BP's U.S. pipeline business includes a network of 3,500 miles (5,633 kilometers) of pipelines and terminal facilities that transport and store more than 1.3 million barrels per day of oil, refined products and natural gas. In addition to the Gulf Coast and Midwest assets, BP operates pipelines in the Pacific Northwest.Under U.S. tax codes, MLPs are partnerships that do not pay corporate income tax on distributions, or earnings, to partners. The partners, or owners, are responsible for paying taxes on the distributions.BP's potential IPO of its midstream assets comes at a rough time for the U.S. pipeline sector.While pipeline operators derive profit from long-term contracts not linked to commodity price gyrations, the dip in oil prices in recent years has nonetheless weighed on the sector, said Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions.There's this perception in the market that the midstream sector is meant to be insulated from the volatility of the commodity price movement, said Essner. But retail investors have gotten spooked by oil markets. The price of crude oil has fallen sharply in recent months, with oil overall down nearly 14 percent this year. The Alerian MLP exchange-traded fund (AMLP.K), which tracks the performance of more than two dozen midstream companies, has lost more than 4 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tuesday's announcement came after the market closed. BP is worth 88 billion GBP ($114.8 billion) and its shares closed on Tuesday in London at 445.80 GBP a share.BP is still paying down costs from the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion at its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The company is set to pay up to $5.5 billion in cash payments to U.S. authorities this year as part of one settlement. BP has sharply reduced its capital spending over the past three years in the face of a drop in oil prices, but it still requires an oil price of around $60 a barrel in order to cover its costs, dividends and penalties. The lesson for BP from Shell's experience is a master limited partnership drawing on existing assets can allow it to get cash and continuing income from its capital-intensive operations while still working closely with the asset owners.We prioritize our assets and maintain strategic control, said John Hollowell, chief executive of Shell Midstream Partners in an interview last month referring only to Shell's decision-making. The key part for us is allows to have the best of both worlds. We can monetize and maintain control of the asset.

One of new management's first corrections was to exit the cotton space, said Brandon Crozier, chief executive since November. Cotton is capital intensive and CGG lacked the expertise and balance sheet to succeed in that market, he said. This year CGG aims to trade some 800,000 tonnes of corn, down from 7 million tonnes of grains in 2014, as the firm focuses on improving profit margins through more efficient capital management.CGG, one of the few Brazilian companies set up to both produce and trade agricultural commodities internationally, is also looking at ways to improve its farming business. The company owns 100,000 hectares of land, 70 percent of which is arable, with a productive capacity of 350,000 tonnes of grain, according to executives. Third parties are farming the land this year while CGG carries out its turnaround.When CGG resumes farming, executives said they will focus on non-GMO, high-protein soymeal, industrial organics and alternative rotation crops like sorghum, which it hopes will give it an edge in niche markets.

The three private equity investors are putting the finishing touches to their rival offers ahead of a July 19 deadline, the sources said, cautioning that price expectations might be hard to match. The company's 3 billion pound price tag and its exposure to the consumer credit market, which is facing tighter regulation and a possible spending slowdown after Britain leaves the European Union, have raised concern among prospective bidders that final offers may fall short of expectations, the sources said. Shop Direct, Hellman & Friedman, BC Partners and Apax declined to comment. The Barclay brothers have backed the British retailer for almost 15 years.

Three sources with knowledge of the discussions said the two state-owned firms have been in negotiations for months, though any agreement could still be some time away. The talks between two of China's largest metals producers are part of Beijing's broad efforts to shake up its indebted and inefficient state sector, streamline the number of companies and create globally competitive firms in sectors including power generation, shipping and metals. Minmetals, which controls Hong Kong-listed unit MMG, said it was not aware of any discussions over a tie-up and said it would publish any statement on its website. China National Gold - one of the top gold miners in a country that has become the world's largest producer - declined to comment. The State Assets and Supervision Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees the sector and favors an overall shake-up, did not respond to a request for comment. A combination of Minmetals, one of China's biggest state-owned enterprises, and much smaller, precious metals-focused CNG would not be without challenges, not least in terms of scale. It was not immediately clear how a combined group would be managed. China Minmetals, already a major mining company, became the world's largest metallurgical construction and operation services company after merging with state-owned China Metallurgical Group in 2015. [reut.rs/2u0rZ8V] With total assets of around $236 billion globally, Minmetals became one of the world's largest copper miners when it bought Australia's Oz Minerals in 2009 and Glencore's Las Bambas copper mine in Peru for $7 billion in 2014 - one of China's largest overseas acquisitions at the time.Debt racked up as a result of the Peru deal, combined with plunging global commodities prices then dragged Minmetals to a loss. It reported an 18.2 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) loss in 2015. That turned around to a 4.1 billion yuan profit in 2016. It signed an exploration deal with Rio Tinto last month, and employs over 240,000 people. China National Gold is a much smaller company, with combined total assets of around $9 billion from its two listed entities. It is China's only gold industry firm directly managed by the central government, with operations also in silver, copper and molybdenum.China Minmetals owns eight listed companies in China and Hong Kong, including Metallurgical Corporation of China which has a market capitalization of around $15 billion, and MMG with a $3 billion market value. The two listed units under China National Gold have a combined market value of around $5.8 billion. Management Changes? The management make-up of a merged entity is not clear. One of the sources said China Minmetals' Chairman He Wenbo, 62, was expected to be near retirement. And Guo Wenqing, president, is expected to move to SASAC after the 19th communist party congress that is to be held later this year, the source added. China National Gold's board members, by contrast, are newly confirmed, having been appointed by SASAC just months ago.Minmetals did not reply immediately to a Reuters request for comment on its personnel changes. If carried out, this would be the second marriage of metals companies overseen by Beijing as part of the government's goal to fight overcapacity in its bloated heavy industries. Last year, Baosteel's takeover of its smaller, debt-laden rival Wuhan created China's largest steelmaker.Coal giant Shenhua Group Corp Ltd [SHGRP.UL] and top-five state power producer China Guodian Corp [CNGUO.UL] are in talks to merge some assets, Reuters reported in June.

Leading homegrown online retailer Flipkart has revised its offer for SoftBank-backed Snapdeal to between $900 million and $950 million, said the sources, adding the new proposal is being evaluated by Snapdeal's board. Reuters previously reported that Snapdeal had earlier this month rejected Flipkart's initial bid of between $800 million and $850 million as its board was unsatisfied with the offer and the payment terms. Flipkart's revised offer was made for Snapdeal's marketplace and its e-commerce solutions provider Unicommerce, but does not include its logistics arm Vulcan Express and digital payments unit FreeCharge, which may be sold separately, said the sources, who did not want to be named as the discussions are not public. One of the sources said Flipkart may withhold $150 million of the deal price for 12-24 months after the consummation of a deal. Both sources said negotiations to address the concerns of Flipkart and Snapdeal shareholders were continuing. Japan's SoftBank (9984.T) is Snapdeal's biggest shareholder.Flipkart plans to absorb Snapdeal's employees, but it has not given any assurances around levels of employee retention, said one of the sources, noting that this was a sticking point in the talks.

The family has lodged an appeal with the Tokyo High Court, their lawyer said, calling the ruling unjust. The descendents of the Idemitsu founder, Sazo Idemitsu, have been locked in a battle with the Japanese refiner's management for more than a year over the proposed Showa Shell buyout. The new share sale would dilute the family's stake and make it harder for them to oppose the deal. Idemitsu, however, has earlier said it planned to sell 48 million new shares, equivalent to 30 percent of its outstanding shares, mainly to raise funds and help repay loans. The court recognizes the management's intention to dilute the founding family's stake, according to court papers seen by Reuters. But it also recognizes the firm's need to raise funds to repay 159 billion yen ($1.42 billion) in loans - taken to buy Showa Shell shares - that will be up for redemption on Dec. 18.Idemitsu, Japan's No.2refiner by sales, in December 2016 completed the purchase of just under a third of Showa Shell, the first stage in its buyout of the smaller competitor. It had planned to refinance the debt with subordinated loans but lenders have refused to provide it with the terms they had previously agreed, following the founding family's firm opposition to the deal, the court paper shows. The court cannot categorically determine the main objective of the new share issue is to enhance management's position, rather than to raise fund, according to the paper.The new share sale, calculations by Thomson Reuters show, would cut the founding family's stake in Idemitsu to about 26 percent, from more than a third now, eliminating its ability to veto the Showa deal. The family says the two firms' cultures will not mesh. If the deal goes through, it would be the second in Japan's bloated refining sector after JX Holdings Inc bought TonenGeneral Sekiyu.Idemitsu shares ended down 3 percent at 2,646 yen, while Showa Shell gained 4.4 percent.

Toshiba is scrambling to complete the sale of its chip unit to help cover billions in losses at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit. But the auction has stalled on disagreements among members of the groups bidding for the world's No. 2 NAND producer as well as a legal battle with Western Digital Corp, its memory chip joint venture partner. U.S. hedge fund Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, said on Friday the stock may be worth as much as 400 yen once the company resolves its dispute with Western Digital and clears uncertainties around Westinghouse. Toshiba shares closed up 19 percent on Tuesday at 275.8 yen, giving the crisis-wracked firm a market value of around $10.4 billion. The Tokyo market was closed on Monday for a national holiday. The stock is still down around 30 percent compared with levels since late December when it flagged potential billions in losses. I wouldn't recommend Toshiba to investors. This is a company that cannot even announce its earnings. It could have been delisted, said Fujio Ando, an adviser at Chibagin Securities. Toshiba plans to start selling OLED TVs in the autumn but LG is selling them at half their price. Toshiba could end up losing money on that, he added. Western Digital has sought a U.S. court injunction to block the sale, arguing that any sale requires its consent. The U.S. court judge on Friday postponed a decision on the injunction and proposed requiring Toshiba to give Western Digital two weeks notice before closing the sale. The ruling allows Toshiba to proceed with negotiations for now, although it is not expected to help resolve the standoff with Western Digital or speed up the sale process.Sources have said the auction is also being complicated by a demand by SK Hynix Inc, a member of a Japanese government-backed group chosen by Toshiba as a preferred bidder, that it be given an equity stake in the unit. Toshiba said last week that it was also considering offers from Western Digital and Foxconn due to the lack of progress in discussions with the preferred bidder.

Oaktree, which owns a 19.9 percent stake in Tembec, said on Monday there is a significant value gap between Rayonier's offer price and the real value of Tembec. Rayonier, which makes high-value cellulose specialties fibers, said in May it would buy Tembec for $807 million to expand into packaging and forest products. Oaktree said Tembec's board claimed the support of Fairfax Financial Holdings, which then held a 19.99 percent stake in Tembec. Fairfax has sold off its entire stake in June. Fairfax still has voting rights but no economic interest in Tembec, and this makes it unfair to shareholders that Fairfax's empty votes should determine Tembec's future course, Oaktree said. Rayonier and Tembec were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours. Oaktree, which last week decided to vote against the deal, said the deal in its current form is unlikely to close, and that it had received significant shareholder support since announcing its opposition. Terming Tembec's claim that the deal was the result of a comprehensive sale process as misleading, Oaktree said Tembec was relying on an apples-to-oranges comparison. Oaktree accused Tembec's board of conducting a piecemeal process over a number of years by offering some or all of Tembec assets at different times, creating confusion among buyers. It also termed Rayonier's offer as unsolicited and opportunistic and not being part of any formal sale process, and questioned the timing of the sale when Tembec's business was improving.

Washington Companies, founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Washington, has mining, industrial and transportation businesses across North America. Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, launched a sales process in March following the initial unsolicited approach from Washington. A competing bid for Dominion is unlikely other than from global miner Rio Tinto, Dominion's joint venture partner at Diavik, BMO analyst Edward Sterck said.

Simkins said talks with Ottawa would start on Monday. The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, also requires approval from more than two-thirds of Dominion shareholders. Washington's higher offer came after the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's biggest pension fund manager, was reported to be considering a bid for Dominion.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-regulation-ipos-idUSKBN1A20EG","New UK listing rules set to attract state companies beyond Aramco","","Jul 17 2017","Proposed changes to Britain's listing regime are likely to attract a series of state-backed companies to London's stock markets as governments in oil rich states prepare for a wave of asset sales.","LONDON (Reuters) - Proposed changes to Britain's listing regime are likely to attract a series of state-backed companies to London's stock markets as governments in oil rich states prepare for a wave of asset sales.However some investors and corporate governance groups say Britain's move to make its capital markets attractive to state-controlled firms by loosening some of the rules may lower the quality of companies on its stock exchange and leave shareholders with less protection when things go wrong. The UK financial regulator proposed a new premium listing category for state-owned companies on Thursday, intended to make the market more attractive for oil giant Saudi Aramco as it plans what is expected to be the world's largest ever initial public offering. The move was applauded by Britain's financial lobby groups as helping to make sure the country's capital markets remain attractive once it leaves the European Union.Capital markets lawyers say that as well as Saudi Arabia, the changes will appeal to a number of countries that are also in the midst of asset privatization plans.This broadens the appeal of London for companies in countries like Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and southern Europe, Raj Karia, partner at law firm Norton Rose, told Reuters. There are a lot of companies globally which are state owned and will be privatized and in the run up to Brexit, London is appealing to the world outside of Europe. Falling oil prices have spurred privatizations across the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia, Oman and Abu Dhabi all announcing plans in the past year to float some of their oil assets. Government asset sales are also expected from Romania and Greece. Nicholas Holmes, a partner at law firm Ashurst, said it was clear the proposed rules were aimed at attracting further sovereign business in London beyond Aramco.However he cautioned that the changes risked undoing some reforms made to Britain's listing rules in 2014 following a number of scandals. London-listed mining companies Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) from Kazakhstan and Bumi from Indonesia both left minority investors nursing heavy losses which were both blamed on dealings involving company insiders and controlling shareholders. That led to the rule changes, with such companies forced to ensure that all transactions between a controlling shareholder or their associates and the company are conducted on an arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms. These rules will not apply to sovereign-controlled companies under the new proposed listing structure when dealing with the parent state, provided it holds at least 30 percent of the shares. The fear is that we are rolling back a portion of sensible reforms which came as a result of past scandals such as ENRC. The risk is a dilution of the premium listing brand, Ashurst's Holmes said.People walk through the lobby of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 25, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File photoShareholder groups and investors agreed.Our initial reaction is that investors and savers should be nervous about any dilution of existing protections which were specifically introduced to avoid a repetition of the governance issues associated with Bumi and ENRC, said Catherine Howarth, Chief Executive of ShareAction. Euan Stirling, Head of Stewardship and ESG (environmental, social and governance) Investment at Standard Life, one of the biggest investors in the British stock market, said the move sent the wrong signal.We would prefer to see listing rules tightened rather than loosened, he said.Likely Contenders Sources said Kazakh energy company KazMunaiGas is one of the most likely state-backed companies aside from Aramco to take advantage of Britain's proposed new listing rules. It is currently selecting advisers for its planned 2019 initial public offering and is expected to consider London.Kazakhstan is listed as number 131 out of 176 on the Transparency International corruption perception index. The company was not immediately available to comment.Reeling from the collapse of its merger with Deutsche Bourse and a slowdown in large domestic listings, the London Stock Exchange is targeting emerging markets, and the Middle East in particular, as a source of new IPOs. Including Saudi Aramco, Riyadh aims to raise around $200 billion in the next several years through privatization programs in 16 sectors. Fighting a budget deficit, Kuwait is also considering privatizing some assets. United Arab Emirates could raise $1.5 to $2 billion for Abu Dhabi's national oil company. That is initially expected to be a local listing which does not rule out the company tapping the London market in future.With smaller deal sizes, Egypt plans to list shares in a state-owned bank and companies including Banque du Caire and Arab African International Bank.Some of the large Middle East companies will be suitable for a listing in London, though some could opt for their local exchange. Russian state-owned companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft are already on the London exchange using the less popular standard listing structure, but will now find it easier to achieve the conditions for a premium listing. For investors, the next step to watch will be whether any companies listed under the new rules will be eligible for including in any stock market indices, meaning they can raise funds from passive index-tracking funds.FTSE, which runs the main UK stock indices, has already indicated that it will not include Aramco. It said its eligibility criteria for FTSE inclusion would not change if the new listing rules come into force.Additional reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Giles Elgood"

However, the company now appears set to go down the IPO track after the two final bidders for the company were not willing to match the price Toshiba expects to receive through the public listing, one of the sources said.

The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the deal.A spokesman for Landis+Gyr said a simple sale of the company was still an option.The IPO price range was set last week at 70 to 82 Swiss francs per share, giving a market value of between 2.1 billion francs and 2.4 billion francs ($2.5 billion). A third source familiar with the matter expected the shares to sell in the top third of that range.The shares are due to start trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange on July 21.

Initial public offerings (IPOs) are an option for Freight One, Russia's largest private railway operator, for UCL Port, which includes port assets in the Baltic, Black and Azov Seas, and for Volgo-Balt Transport Holding (VBTH), which manages shipping and shipyard assets, Lisin said. If the investment activity on the transportation market improves, then the most practical and the best thing to do is an IPO ... We are talking to various Russian and Western companies and are on the lookout (for investors), Lisin said in his first media interview. The group would like to attract one or two strategic investors for the assets prior to their IPOs, Lisin, who is on the board of Freight One, said. We will continue to develop our transport assets. Transit options via Russian ports should be improved, he said, declining to disclose the names of potential investors or a timeline or location for the IPOs. Dmitry, 36, is the eldest son of Lisin, Russia's third richest man whose wealth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $16.1 billion. This partly comes from his controlling stake in Russia's biggest steelmaker NLMK (NLMK.MM). Lisin senior is one of the most prominent entrepreneurs in Russia and has been involved a range of businesses since the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union.His son Dmitry, like many other children of Russian tycoons, has become part of a second generation of post-Soviet businessmen.Dmitry said he had originally been preparing to study neurosurgery in Britain but he switched to finance and philosophy instead when his father began to give him some management responsibilities in the early 2000s. He later returned to Russia. Asked whether he was preparing to take the reins of all of his father's business one day, he said that running a business was never an easy task and cited how much red tape there was to deal with in Russia. In the United States business is overregulated too and in recent times there is a lot of anti-Russian feeling there, he said. It's very hard to get a green light for deals - 90 percent of the time goes on dealing with bureaucracy. NLMK is one of the five largest steelmakers in the United States. In December, his father sold a 1.5 percent stake in NLMK, in a deal which banking sources said was aimed at raising capital for a possible purchase of container company Transcontainer (TRCN.MM) by Freight One.

Volkswagen (VW) is working with Citi (C.N) to decide on the future of Renk, which may result in a sale of the maker of transmissions and bearings used in ships to wind turbines, the sources said. If a formal decision to sell Renk is taken, an auction could be kicked off as early as this autumn and the company could be valued at 600-800 million euros ($687-$916 million), they added. VW and Citi declined to comment.VW is reining in spending, including cutting thousands of jobs at its core passenger-car brand, to help pay for a multibillion-euro shift to embrace electric cars and new mobility services. It has already launched a sale of motorcycle brand Ducati. Renk is 76 percent owned by VW unit MAN (MANG.DE) and had 390 million euros in equity and 214 million in cash, according to its 2016 annual report.Last year, Renk posted profit before taxes of 65 million euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about 80 million euros on sales of 496 million.Bidders are expected to value the business at about 8-9 times its expected core earnings, a slight discount to peers such as Timken (TKR.N), Rexnord (RXN.N) and Allison Transmission (ALSN.N), which trade at 9-10 times. Renk may be worth 10 times. But a buyer will need to offer minority shareholders a small premium. That could mean that Volkswagen will get slightly less for its stake, one of the people said. Renk is expected to attract interest from private equity groups such as KKR, CVC, Cinven, Carlyle and Advent, the sources said. Separately, some Renk peers are expected to look at the asset.

The joint venture, to be led by Centrica's head of exploration and production (E&P;), will produce 50-55 million barrels this year and have access to 625 million barrels of proved and probable oil and gas reserves. Centrica will own 69 percent of the new entity and raise its interests in younger fields, including the Cygnus gas field which started producing in December, as well as dilute its decommissioning costs and reduce its capital expenditure needs. Bayerngas Norge, in return, gets access to a profitable business, further expertise and a bigger balance sheet. This joint venture creates a larger, more sustainable and more capable European E&P; business, Centrica Chief Executive Iain Conn said in a statement. The British utility has been trying to reduce reliance on its oil and gas business following its decision to focus more on providing services in the energy retail market. There is potential for an IPO (initial public offering) of the newly created business which will continue Centrica's journey towards a downstream customer-focused energy and services provider, analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote, adding that the news was positive for Centrica shareholders. Shares in Centrica were trading up 0.5 percent at 1008 GMT. The deal comes a year after British oil major BP agreed to merge its Norwegian oil and gas business in a $1.3 billion deal with Norway's Det norske. A three-year drop in oil prices has led companies producing oil and gas in the costly North Sea region to find new ways to squeeze value out of their businesses, often by selling assets or joining up operations. As part of Monday's deal, Centrica agreed to make a series of deferred payments totaling 340 million pounds ($444 million) between 2017 and 2022 for dismantling some of its oldest fields. Stadwerke Muenchen and Bayerngas, owners of unlisted Bayerngas Norge, will own 31 percent of the joint venture.

This is an unstoppable trend, Cheung wrote in the email. This decision to sell the magazines is an important part of the transition plan, and it shows the transition work is basically complete. Vice chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association Sham Yee-lan said the magazine had suffered because of businesses pulling ads due to its political stance. Most of Hong Kong's mainstream publications have fallen in line when covering news that China thinks is sensitive. They censor themselves, Sham said. Next Magazine is one of the very few outlets that do not try to please Beijing when covering sensitive news. It has guts. So people are worried now ... this will have a huge impact.

This is in line with Beijing's measures to control potential systemic risk, including problems posed by domestic companies acquiring more global assets. China launched a clampdown on capital outflows and overseas direct investment last year. The curbs on funding for Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focus on six overseas acquisitions, four of which have already been completed, according to an internal bank document seen by Reuters. Banks have been told not to finance the deals or to allow Wanda to use its offshore assets as collateral for financing.The property-to-entertainment giant will also not be allowed to inject cash from its onshore business to help the offshore subsidiaries, according to the document.Nor will overseas units be allowed to be folded into Wanda's locally listed firms, it added. Relevant government bodies should not provide support to help Wanda sell its overseas assets to Chinese buyers, according to the bank document. One of the sources said Wanda was perceived to have violated Beijing's measures brought in last year to tighten controls on money moving out of the country. Wanda declined to comment on the document or its contents. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier in the day that banks met regulators and were advised of restrictions around Wanda's assets. This comes after a Reuters report last month that showed CBRC had ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by some firms that have been on a buying spree, including Wanda. Run by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, Wanda is one of a handful of Chinese conglomerates that have expanded aggressively abroad over the past few years, into areas well beyond their original business - in this case, property. Wanda, which owns a stake in soccer club Atletico Madrid, has over the past few years bought film producer Legendary, theater chains AMC Entertainment Holdings, Odeon & UCI Cinemas and Nordic Cinema Group, as well as a UK luxury yacht maker. Last week, it sold a portfolio of tourism projects and hotels to developer Sunac China Holdings (1918.HK) for $9.3 billion - a major step back for Wanda's billionaire owner who had said his wolf pack of theme parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).

Suedwestbank is majority owned by a holding company for twin brothers Andreas and Thomas Struengmann, billionaires from their sale of generics drugmaker Hexal to Novartis in 2005. It has around 100,000 retail and corporate customers in the prosperous Baden-Wuerttemberg province around Stuttgart. Suedwestbank has total assets of more than 7 billion euros($8.02 billion) and 650 staff in its 28-branch network that combines traditional lending with asset and wealth management. It made a 2016 operating profit before tax of 79 million euros. Unlisted BAWAG, Austria's fourth-biggest bank, has more than 2.2 million customers and 40 billion euros in assets. It has said for years it was on the lookout for takeovers -- especially in Austria, Germany and Switzerland -- to expand. Reuters reported in May that BAWAG planned to buy the German bank. The expertise and long-standing tradition of Suedwestbank, which operates in a very strong economic region of Germany, make the bank an ideal partner to help us expand our footprint and customer base, said BAWAG Chief Executive Anas Abuzaakouk. The sale is due to close in 2017 and is subject to regulatory approvals. The banks said they agreed not to disclose the purchase price or any details of the agreement. Cerberus owns 52 percent of BAWAG and GoldenTree Asset Management 40 percent. BAWAG has been on the takeover trail, with five other deals over the past 18 months. In February its easybank direct bank agreed to buy the PayLife commercial card issuing business of SIX Payment Services Austria. Unlike other Austrian banks that expanded heavily in central and eastern Europe, BAWAG focuses on Austria, where it holds two-thirds of its customer loan book. It also does retail, corporate, commercial real estate and portfolio lending in western Europe and the United States. BAWAG is also moving ahead with preparations for an initial public share offer that could value it at up to 5 billion euros. Reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Adrian Croft"

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory unit to cover losses from its nuclear reactor business.In late June, Toshiba announced its preferred bidder was a group made up of Bain Capital, South Korean chip maker SK Hynix and Japanese-government backed banks that offered $18 billion. Western Digital, which is also bidding, sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court in mid-June, saying it believed a joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba needs its consent to sell the flash business. Western Digital's joint venture with Toshiba helps finance equipment at Toshiba's plants in exchange for some of their output.Separately from the California lawsuit, Western Digital is also contesting its consent rights in an international arbitration tribunal. Western Digital filed its lawsuit in San Francisco to prevent Toshiba from closing the sale of its memory unit before arbitration has a chance to play out. At the hearing, Judge Kahn proposed requiring Toshiba to give Western Digital two weeks notice if it believed it would close the sale before the arbitration finished. Toshiba's attorney said they were concerned about agreeing to be bound by the San Francisco court's jurisdiction. Toshiba has argued that because it is a Japanese company and the deal is taking place mostly in Japan, the court should not have jurisdiction. Attorneys for Western Digital subsidiary SanDisk, which is formally party to the case, expressed concern that any order in which Toshiba did not agree to the court's jurisdiction would not be enforceable. The two sides could not agree, so Judge Kahn instructed them to come up with final language for his proposed order and set a new hearing for July 28, when a related dispute between the two will be heard. In a statement, Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan called the proposed order and postponement a victory. Our entire goal was to preserve and protect our rights through the binding arbitration process, and that’s precisely what the court has done today, Milligan said. Toshiba called Judge Kahn's proposed order a 'finessed' alternative to issuing a preliminary injunction and confirmed it agreed not to close a sale before July 28.

Negotiations are focused on the two sides settling on a price, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly on the matter. A deal could be announced within weeks, they said. Trade in Dominion shares was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange minutes after the stock rose 4.74 percent, following Reuters' report on the talks.U.S.-listed shares (DDC.N), which peaked at $13.60 after the report, closed at $13.48 in New York, up 5.6 percent. It was unclear how much Washington had increased its initial unsolicited cash proposal, of $13.50 a share, the catalyst for Dominion to formally put itself up for sale in March. At $13.50 a share, the acquisition would be worth nearly $1.09 billion (C$1.38 billion). Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, rejected Washington's initial advance, saying it undervalued the company. In a statement Friday afternoon, Dominion said it has not made any decisions related to strategic alternatives and there is no assurance that its review will result in a transaction or change in strategy. Washington, which declined to comment, is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Dennis Washington. Washington and other interested parties signed confidentiality agreements to review company data, Dominion said May 1. The sales process, a rarity in the tightly-controlled global diamond industry, attracted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources told Reuters. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, was joined in the data room by small Canadian producer Stornoway Diamond (SWY.TO), which held merger talks with Dominion earlier this year. It was unclear if either had submitted formal bids. CPPIB looked at Dominion's books in 2015, sources said, when the miner worked with investment bank Rothschild & Co to consider ways to boost shareholder value, including a potential sale. There has been ongoing market speculation that global miners Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and Anglo American (AAL.L) were also eying Dominion.Rio operates and holds a 60 percent stake in Diavik, while Anglo's De Beers unit operates the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in the Northwest Territories.

Amazon and Whole Foods declined to comment. Amazon shares closed up 0.1 percent at $1,001.81. Whole Foods rose 0.3 percent to $42.10.Amazon's proposed purchase of Whole Foods could impact neighborhood grocery stores and hardworking consumers across America, the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement. Congress has a responsibility to fully scrutinize this merger before it goes ahead. The deal must be approved by U.S. antitrust enforcers, most likely the Federal Trade Commission. Congress plays no formal role in that process but hearings often highlight the possible impact of deals on consumers. The hearing is unlikely to happen without Republican support.

Prior to the Amazon bid, activist investor group Jana Partners had criticized Whole Foods for high costs associated with its United Natural Foods contract.U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a podcast this month that Amazon's size and clout could hurt small retailers and eventually lead to higher prices. This week, hedge fund manager Douglas Kass from Seabreeze Partners Management Inc said he was shorting shares of the retailer after hearing rumblings on Capitol Hill about Amazon's size and clout. I am shorting Amazon today because I have learned that there are currently early discussions and due diligence being considered in the legislative chambers in Washington, D.C., he wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. If I am correct, word of this could lower Amazon's shares by 10 percent overnight. Kass said in emailed comments to Reuters on Friday that he has what he called a core short position in Amazon, meaning a sizeable bet based on a long-term outlook.This has the potential of being the biggest business news story of year, he said. Kass declined to comment when asked for more details about pressure from Capitol Hill. Kass is followed for his bets on declines in companies' share prices. He shorted Marvel Entertainment in 1992 when its shares were in the high $60s, and the company went bankrupt 1-1/2 years later. He also bet against big U.S. banks leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis, shorting Bank of America, MGIC, Citigroup and several other financials that ultimately averaged a 98 percent price decline by the time they bottomed in 2009.While antitrust experts have said they expected Amazon's bid to win regulatory approval, some critics argue the deal should be blocked because it would give the retailer a big head start towards domination of online grocery delivery.

AT&T;'s post-merger plans were earlier reported by Bloomberg News. The deal, announced in October, is seen as a bold move by the telecommunications giant to acquire content to stream over its network. AT&T; hopes the programming will give it a competitive edge in a saturated wireless market. The deal also brings a wealth of user data for more targeted advertising.The reorganization will leave AT&T; executives in charge of the combined company. John Stankey, who currently leads DirecTV and other entertainment businesses, will head up the media division and John Donovan, AT&T;'s chief strategy officer who oversees technology and operations, will run the wireless business, the source said.

Time Warner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bob Quinn, AT&T; senior executive vice president of external and legislative affairs, told reporters this week that the company expects to close the merger by the end of the year. “We are just working through the process,” Quinn said, noting it also needs approvals from some international agencies and the U.S. Justice Department. “All indications are that end of the year is definitely in reach.” He declined to weigh in on whether the White House could seek to intervene in the merger as some reports have suggested, citing anonymousWhite House aides. U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of Time Warner's news division CNN in recent months, calling the outlet fake news.

Negotiations are currently focused on the two sides settling on a price, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly on the matter. A deal could be announced within weeks, they said. Trade in Dominion shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange was halted pending news. The stock had gained as much as 4.74 percent following Reuters' report on the talks. The U.S.-listed shares soared as much as 6 percent to $13.60, before edging back to $13.44, or up 5.3 percent, in early afternoon trade in New York. It was unclear how much Washington Companies had increased its initial unsolicited cash proposal, of $13.50 a share, which was the catalyst for Dominion to formally put itself up for sale in March. At $13.50 a share, the acquisition would be worth nearly $1.09 billion (C$1.38 billion). Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and a minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, had rejected Washington's initial advance, saying it undervalued the company and that the terms of proposed talks were unacceptable. Washington Companies is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Dennis Washington. Washington Companies declined to comment, while Dominion was not immediately available for comment. Washington and other interested parties signed confidentiality agreements to review company data, Dominion said on May 1. The sales process, a rarity in the tightly-controlled global diamond industry, attracted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources told Reuters. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, was joined in the data room by small Canadian producer Stornoway Diamond. It was unclear if Stornoway, which held merger talks with Dominion earlier this year, or CPPIB had submitted formal bids. CPPIB looked at Dominion's books in 2015, sources said, when the miner worked with investment bank Rothschild & Co to consider ways to boost shareholder value, including a potential sale. There has been ongoing market speculation that diversified global miners Rio Tinto and Anglo American were also eying Dominion.Rio operates and holds a 60 percent stake in Diavik, while Anglo's De Beers unit operates the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in the Northwest Territories.

The IPO could be launched around September, when the people expect Neoenergia SA to have won industry regulatory approval for Elektro Eletricidade & Serviços SA's takeover. Antitrust agency Cade gave the nod to the takeover on July 4. Spain's Iberdrola SA will have 52.4 percent of Neoenergia once the takeover is completed. The dual listing will be a so-called secondary offer, allowing Banco do Brasil SA and pension fund Previ Fundação [PREVI.UL] to sell part of their 9.4-percent and 38-percent stakes, respectively, in Neoenergia, the people said. Banco do Brasil, Iberdrola and Previ declined to comment, while Neoenergia said that no decision has been taken yet on a potential debut offering. The people spoke under condition of anonymity because the plan remains private. Listing Neoenergia in both stock markets would give the utility access to a wide base of investors seeking greater exposure to an industry that for years has struggled with erratic policies, a harsh recession and high borrowing costs. Chinese power conglomerates have become the dominant force in Brazil's power industry with high-profile acquisitions that have resulted in delistings. State Grid Corp of China's $12.1 billion purchase of CPFL Energia SA - the largest-ever foreign acquisition in Brazil - involves a buyout of small shareholders. Shares of Iberdrola reversed early losses, and were up 0.3 percent at 6.904 euros on Friday afternoon in Madrid. Shares of Banco do Brasil added 1 percent to 29.40 reais in São Paulo. Investment Banks When announcing the Elektro acquisition on June 8, Iberdrola committed to list Neoenergia when Previ and Banco do Brasil deemed it appropriate. Neoenergia's business scope includes power generation, transmission and distribution across Brazil, in an area almost five times as big as Iberdrola's in Spain. With 13.4 million customers in Brazil, the Elektro deal could be followed by a transfer of Iberdrola's wind farm assets to the combined entity. Banco do Brasil, the country's No. 1 state-controlled lender, is looking for investment-banking peers to help it underwrite the IPO, two of the people said, naming Banco Santander Brasil SA, Morgan Stanley & Co and Credit Suisse Group AG as candidates. Other local investment banks vying for underwriting roles include Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA, the people said. The banks declined to comment. In the wake of the Elektro acquisition, Neoenergia said combined annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 3.6 billion reais ($1.12 billion) last year on a proforma basis, on revenue of about 31 billion reais. If successful, Neoenergia's IPO may be one of Brazil's largest this year. The last stock market debut of a Brazilian electricity company in Brazil took place in July 2013, when CPFL Energias Renováveis SA raised about 364 million reais($113 million) from investors. Still, efforts by President Michel Temer's administration to undo some of the policies of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff - who imposed caps on project returns and renegotiated contracts that led to copious losses - have revived industry equity offerings. Over the past year, utilities have raised 3.6 billion reais through equity offerings, more than in the prior four years, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Popular was taken over by Santander on June 7 for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. The lender estimated the maximum cost of its initiative at 680 million euros ($775 million) and said its plan would have no impact on the group's earnings nor additional capital impact. As part of its acquisition, Santander has launched a 7.1 billion euro rights issue. Santander said that it had taken the decision given the exceptional circumstances and also for commercial reasons and to foster customer loyalty. As part of the initiative, Santander said it was planning to issue up to 980 million euros nominal value of perpetual bonds. Santander did not detail how many shareholders would be affected by its offer. A source with knowledge of the offer said more than 110,000 retail investors of Popular could benefit, around a third of its minority stakeholders. Some retail investors and junior bond investors, affected by Popular's rescue, have already begun filing lawsuits to determine who was responsible. FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a Banco Popular and Santander banks offices in Barcelona, Spain June 7, 2017.Albert Gea/File PhotoSpanish and European authorities said that Popular needed to be rescued due its weak liquidity situation after a bank run. In order to benefit from the offer, customers would be required to waive the right to pursue legal actions against Santander, the lender said. Santander said that the plan excluded institutional investors and was directed at retail clients who acquired shares from May 26 to June 21 of 2016, during the period of Banco Popular's last capital increase of around 2.5 billion euros. It would also include retail clients who acquired subordinated obligations computable as Tier 2 of the July 29, 2011 and Oct. 14, 2011 issues of Popular. In both cases, the plan would apply to customers who had their investments deposited in any of the retail networks of the Popular or Santander at the time of the resolution. Santander said that those who invested up to 100,000 euros would receive the total amount of the investment, which was the case of 99 percent of Popular clients and employees who bought shares during Popular's capital rights issue in 2016. Members of the board of directors of Popular and major shareholders would be excluded from this plan, Santander said.

It will continue to invest its own capital in new franchises and wholly owned clinics.American Development Partners will finance the acquisition and development of land for the urgent care centers, and will purchase equipment and provide working capital. It will recoup its investment by collecting lease payments from franchisees.This isn't a private equity infusion per se, said William Koleszar, chief marketing officer at American Family Care in an interview.It's private capital working with small business owners to make healthcare more accessible to local communities.The new facilities will be primarily focused in states that American Family Care considers likely to have strong uptake of urgent care centers, ranging from Florida, to Illinois, to Texas.Birmingham, Alabama-based American Family Care was founded by Bruce Irwin and now serves more than 3 million patients per year.Urgent care has benefited in recent years by a drive by insurers and health providers to cut costs. Based on the same principles as retailers, urgent care centers aim to offer a cheaper and more efficient alternative to visting a doctor's office or emergency room. They typically promise to service patients on a walk-in basis and accept payments for services like x-rays or stitches from people with or without health insurance.Earlier this year, buyout firm Warburg Pincus LLC acquired a majority stake in urgent care provider CityMD, valuing it at around $600 million, Reuters reported.Reporting by Carl O'Donnell in New York; Editing by Richard Pullin"

The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval in a bid to protect critical infrastructure, including power grids and hospitals. The move reflects pressure across Europe to limit takeovers by Chinese state-backed groups of prized European assets. We are concerned about the relevant moves of Germany and Europe, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing. China's trade and business links with Germany and the European Union have brought real benefits to the peoples and companies of both sides and promoted economic growth, he added. China hopes that Germany and the EU can avoided being affected by protectionist tendencies, and not send a confused, negative message to the rest of the world, Geng said. The purchase last year of German robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) by Chinese company Midea (000333.SZ) raised concern that China was gaining too much access to key technologies while shielding its own companies from foreign takeovers. State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, China's biggest overseas acquisition to date, has increased pressure in Europe to curb foreign takeovers in strategically important sectors.

GLP, which is Asia's biggest warehouse operator and boasts a $41 billion portfolio of assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States, is benefiting from rising demand logistics facilities driven by a boom in e-commerce from clients such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JD.com Inc (JD.O). The winning bid of China's Hopu Investment Management, Hillhouse Capital Group, real estate developer Vanke Group (000002.SZ) (2202.HK) and the financial service investment arm of Bank of China was backed by GLP CEO Ming Mei, which trumped an offer by a Warburg Pincus-led consortium - the only other short-listed bidder. The group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing an 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price and a 25 percent premium over its last full trading day before the announcement. Surprisingly, the acquisition is not conditional on getting antitrust approvals or a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), among others, at a time when regulators are vetting takeovers more closely. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns 37 percent of GLP and is its biggest shareholder, is supporting the transaction but is free to accept an unmatched superior offer. GIC played hard to get a decent offer, said a person with direct knowledge of the deal. There's a good premium with very few strings attached. Related CoverageVanke says deal to buy out GLP will help its logistics property businessLast year, GIC nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business after its shares tumbled over a period of two years starting in 2015. GLP then hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser and Allen & Gledhill as its legal adviser to work on the review. The seven-month auction for GLP was marred by complaints from some potential bidders about a lack of transparency and the perceived advantages of the Chinese consortium through their business ties. GLP then formed a committee of independent directors and said it took measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. It said on Friday that it chose the Chinese consortium because it had more deal certainty and limited conditionality, reducing execution risk. GLP shares soared 22 percent on Friday to a record high. Before Friday's jump, the shares had surged nearly 50 percent since late last year when GIC requested the strategic review.Booming Sector Investors including Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] have splashed more than $12 billion on the logistics sector in China since 2013, betting a surge in online shopping will spur demand for delivery and warehousing services. Analysts said GLP, which earns the majority of its revenue from China, was especially well positioned to benefit from the e-commerce boom.Their substantial footprint in some of the largest global economies make them well positioned to leverage improving global industrial trade and services, including the rapidly rising share of e-commerce in global retail, said Priyaranjan Kumar, regional executive director of Cushman & Wakefield's Asia Pacific capital markets group. To build a similar platform would take many years and present its own set of economic challenges, he said.The bid for GLP stands out at a time when China's outbound M&A; volumes nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 following Beijing's crackdown on capital outflows, data showed, and its new scrutiny of acquisitive groups is set to dampen Asian deal flow further. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the lead joint financial advisers for the consortium and are providing the financial resources confirmation related to the purchase. DBS Bank and China International Capital Corporation also advised the consortium. Goldman and Citi are putting up $5 bln to help fund the deal, sources said. Goldman and Citi declined comment.

The Financial Conduct Authority's proposals on Thursday would create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states and come as exchanges vie to win the Aramco initial public offering, which is set to be the largest ever.But they met with criticism from British fund managers, who have already expressed concerns about Aramco's governance. Investors believe a premium listed segment without these investor protections is not a premium segment and will not provide the protections that investors expect, Chris Cummings, chief executive at the Investment Association said.Reuters reported earlier this year that the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) was working on a new type of structure that would make the bourse more attractive for Aramco. No decision has been made on the venue yet, a source close to Aramco told Reuters following Thursday's proposals, which come as the government and City of London are trying to keep Britain's financial markets attractive to international investors and companies after it leaves the European Union. The FCA is proposing a new premium stock market listing category that will exempt companies controlled by sovereign states from certain requirements and also be available to companies listed in London using depositary receipts, financial instruments used to represent a foreign company's shares.Companies including Russian state firms Gazprom (GZPRI.MM) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) use depositary receipts on the LSE. Related CoverageUK fund trade body says listing rule changes could hurt investor protectionRefining the listing regime in this way would make UK markets more accessible whilst ensuring that the protections afforded by our premium listing regime are focused and proportionate, FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said. But Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Corporate Governance Manager at Royal London Asset Management said this may reverse progress made on governance and protecting minority shareholders.It looks like the FCA is consulting on amending the existing listing rules to accommodate the peculiarities of one company, which is not a very effective strategy for regulating the market as a whole, Hamilton Claxton said.The London Stock Exchange has made winning the listing of Aramco a priority, with the firm's chief executive Xavier Rolet joining Prime Minister Theresa May on a trip to Saudi Arabia in April. The pair met jointly with the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which will play a major role in the listing decision.FILE PHOTO: Oil tanks seen at the Saudi Aramco headquarters during a media tour at Damam city November 11, 2007.Ali Jarekji/File PhotoThe FCA's Bailey told Reuters he had not discussed the proposal with the government.It was not instigated by the government or the LSE which we regulate, he said. The New York Stock Exchange, which is also competing for the Aramco listing, has not offered any such regulatory changes, a source familiar with talks between NYSE and Aramco said.However, it already has certain features that would attract Aramco, including not setting any minimum requirement for the proportion of a company's stock that has to be listed.London usually requires a free float of at least a quarter of a company's shares, although under the proposals a sovereign-backed company could circumvent this if it issued depository receipts representing a small proportion of the overall firm.Bridging the Gulf Under the plans, sovereign-controlled companies will be able to get a premium listing without complying with certain rules on related party transactions and controlling shareholders. The changes are likely to make London more attractive to state-controlled companies as several Gulf countries, including Oman and Abu Dhabi, are considering listing oil assets. This is a clever solution to the dilemma of Aramco, which does not meet the general requirements regarding free-float and corporate governance, Edward Bibko, head of capital markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa at law firm Baker McKenzie, said.At present companies which do not meet Britain's premium listing requirements must take a standard listing which is seen as second best as it has lower corporate governance requirements and does not qualify for entry into most stock indices. The FCA said sovereign owners were different in both their motivations and their nature from private ones so it was legitimate to grant them an exemption from some of the requirements for private companies. We believe that investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership, it said in the consultation document.The FCA has set a deadline of Oct 13 for comment on the proposals, which are part of a wider review it is undertaking into Britain's listing rules but were brought forward because it said it thought there was a gap in its current rules.

The groups argued that after buying Time Warner, owner of HBO and TNT, AT&T; would have the incentive to restrict sales of that programming to cable and online channels.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in June that it would seek to stop the deal because the combined company would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests. We have determined that it is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers, employees and partners to terminate the merger agreement and move forward as an independent company, FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles said in a statement.DraftKings put out a similar statement. We appreciate the continued loyalty of our players - it is you, our customers who have made this all possible - and we look forward to kicking off what is going to be our best NFL season yet! DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement. The lawsuit by the trade commission was just the latest setback for the two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November as a merger of equals. Financial terms of the merger were not disclosed. Each of the companies had been valued at more than $1 billion before New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and other authorities began a crackdown on the industry in 2015. The tie-up was aimed at reducing costs as both companies separately fund legal defenses and lobby for legislation to authorize fantasy sports in states that have declared it illegal. Without a merger, the companies will have to go back to outspending each other to win customers. The companies have a history of aggressive advertising as they battled for market share. But they cut ad spending significantly in 2016 and said a combined company could again expand spending on advertising to attract new customers. In a filing responding to the FTC suit, both companies had defended the planned merger on Wednesday, saying it would not result in higher prices for customers and that regulators were pursuing an unnecessarily rigid and uninformed application of the antitrust laws. Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have exploded online.

Caixa Econômica Federal SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA, Banco do Brasil SA and Banco Bradesco SA are urging larger rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA to join the plan, under which JBS would get a 12-month repayment extension in exchange for a 2 billion-real upfront payment and extra collateral, two of the people said. In principle, banks would not adjust the borrowing cost of those loans because the risk of JBS failing to honor them remains very small, according to one of the people, who asked for anonymity because the plan remains private. Bloomberg News reported on July 12 that a definitive accord had been struck. São Paulo-based JBS said in a statement that the company remains engaged in a long-term relation with financial institutions, with which it has so far maintained productive and constructive talks. The banks declined to comment. A refinancing deal is key to stem concerns of a potential liquidity strain at JBS, whose borrowing costs surged in the wake of the Batista family's decision to enter plea and leniency deals related to their involvement in a bribery and graft ring. Shares (JBSS3.SA) of the São Paulo-based meatpacker and food processor have tanked 18 percent since brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista agreed to a plea deal in mid-May. The company's 7.75 percent bond due in Oct. 2020 46611DAA3= shed up to 20 percent in the same period, sending yields on the security to an all-time high. Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista, the elder of the two brothers who control JBS, is personally negotiating the debt refinancing deal and asset sales to raise cash, the people said. JBS's private-sector banks remain skittish about their state peers' push to remove Batista, two of the people said. Itaú fretted about refinancing loans to JBS in early talks, demanding immediate repayment of a 1 billion-real credit facility due within weeks, the people said. Itaú is not participating in any of JBS's planned asset divestitures, one of the people said. Bribing Politicians Removing Batista has become common ground between government lenders BNDES and Caixa Econômica Federal, Reuters reported on June 22. BNDES owns 22 percent of JBS through investment arm BNDES Participações SA.Caixa, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, is JBS's largest creditor. The refinancing underscores the challenge facing the Batista brothers, who over a decade transformed JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwestern plains into a global behemoth that operates in four continents, with the help of political relations and low-cost government loans. In May, the brothers admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians to facilitate the growth of JBS through BNDES loans. In a plea deal with prosecutors, both implicated President Michel Temer, unleashing a political crisis that threatens to derail the passage of key spending-cutting bills. JPMorgan Securities analyst Natalia Corfield estimates that JBS's total bank debt reached 24.3 billion reais at the end of March, of which about 17.5 billion reais would mature within the next 12 months. The company's total debt, including bond obligations, was almost 59 billion reais. ($1 = 3.2959 Brazilian reais) Editing by Chizu Nomiyama"

Murdoch also owns the Sun and Times newspapers in Britain.Bradley said she would make a final decision on July 14, giving some investors hope that Fox could avert a full investigation if it offered concessions to protect the editorial independence of Sky's 24-hour TV news channel, Sky News.A person familiar with the deal said however the company was unlikely to offer any new remedies, opting instead to let the competition watchdog examine the deal.Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. Britain's political leaders have long sought the backing of Murdoch and his newspapers and any attempt to expand his media empire in the country sparks intense political scrutiny. Rupert's son James, who is chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, said in March that worries about his family exerting too much power were unfounded in an era of online providers such as Facebook, Buzzfeed, Netflix and Google.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-m-a-yandex-idUSKBN19Y10V","Uber and Yandex to combine ride-hailing in Russia and beyond","","Jul 13 2017","Uber and Yandex, the Google of Russia, have agreed to combine their Russian ride-sharing businesses, with Yandex the leading partner in a deal that extends to five nearby markets.","FRANKFURT/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Uber and Yandex, the Google of Russia, have agreed to combine their Russian ride-sharing businesses, with Yandex the leading partner in a deal that extends to five nearby markets. The deal marks another pullback from Uber's breakneck global expansion, a year after its exit from China, though it does have potential upside for the Silicon Valley online taxi hailingpioneer, based on its 36.6 percent stake in the merged company. For months, Uber has struggled with legal setbacks, accusations of a sexist work culture and driver protests, culminating in the June departure of co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick under investor pressure. Shares in Russia's largest internet company leapt almost 20 percent as investors bet the deal could accelerate the move of Yandex's taxi business into profitability. Thursday's agreement follows the recent merger of rival Russian taxi players Fasten and Rutaxi, marking a rapid consolidation of the market. With this deal Yandex eliminates an aggressive competitorwhich, in the long run, will lead to improved monetization and profitability, said Sergey Libin, an analyst with Raiffeisen Bank in Moscow. It's a good deal. San Francisco-based Uber has agreed to invest $225 million (13.5 billion rubles) while Yandex will contribute $100 million into a new joint company in which Yandex will own 59.3 percent and employees will have a 4.1 percent stake. In a joint statement, Yandex and Uber said they would join forces in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan to create a new company operating in 127 cities, in a deal expected to close in the fourth quarter. Yandex.Taxi Chief Executive Tigran Khudaverdyan will become the CEO of the combined business and Yandex will consolidate the new company's results in its financial statements. Yandex will hold four board seats, with Uber holding three, they said. Uber will contribute its UberEATS food delivery business in the six-country region to the new venture.There is ride-sharing and food delivery and beyond that there are also numerous opportunities in logistics that we will explore, Yandex Chief Financial Officer Greg Abovsky said on an investor call. Abovsky added the combined company could be spun off with a separate stock listing in a few years. The share move for Yandex, known as the Google of Russia for its dominance of the region's web search, maps and mobile navigation markets, signals that roughly half of the company's market capitalization lies in investor hopes for its taxi unit. Otkritie brokerage analyst Timur Nigmatullin estimated that, before the deal, Yandex.Taxi represented around 20 percent of the parent company's market capitalization. Otkritie estimated the combination could push the taxi business into profitability by 2018 or 2019. Based on the valuation of the combined company and Yandex's share in it, he said the taxi business now accounted for up to 50 percent of Yandex's equity value, which after Thursday's 18.75 percent rise hovered about $10.5 billion. Lucrative Deal FILE PHOTO: A yandex taxi is seen in central Kiev, Ukraine, May 16, 2017.Gleb Garanich /File PhotoUber said the merger did not imply a strategy of further retrenchment elsewhere. Indeed, financial terms of the deal make it a lucrative one, it said.This is an exciting opportunity in a unique situation and our operations in other countries will not be affected, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the head of Uber in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a blog post addressed to Uber employees. Gore-Coty said Uber's 36.6 percent stake was worth $1.4 billion, based on an agreed valuation of $3.725 billion for the combined company. That marks a sizeable gain on the $170 million Uber invested since entering the region three-and-a-half years ago, even with the new $225 million investment. Uber sold its Chinese business to far larger local rival Didi Chuxing a year ago in return for a 17.5 percent stake in Didi which as a whole was then valued at $35 billion.Slideshow (2 Images)While Uber no longer exists in China, the paper value of its stake in Didi has risen to around $8 billion from $6.1 billion, based on Didi's recent funding round valued at $50 billion. Improved Driving Conditions The unified business in Russia and nearby markets also helps Uber become more sustainable, Gore-Coty said, by helping it cut losses as part of a global drive toward eventual profitability. Uber said in May its net loss, excluding employee stock options and other items, narrowed in the first quarter to $708 million from $991 million in the fourth quarter. This week, it told investors that losses continued to decline in the second quarter, a source familiar with the report said. The ownership stakes reflect how Yandex.Taxi is roughly twice the size of Uber in the region as measured both in terms of rides and gross bookings, the companies said. Yandex and Uber compete in Russia with rivals including Fasten/Rutaxi, Maxim and Gett, the Israeli startup backed by German automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Yandex.Taxi, which was founded in 2011, is active in 127 cities across the region. Uber, founded in 2009, is active in 16 cities in Russia and five cities in Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Uber does not now operate in Armenia or Georgia. Russia's federal anti-monopoly regulator said the deal could pose risks to competition and a thorough analysis was needed before it could be approved, local news agencies reported.Following completion, passengers will be able to continue to use either Yandex or Uber apps. The driver apps of the two companies will be integrated into a single app for greater efficiency, the companies said. Uber operates in nearly 600 cities worldwide.

Germany has become the first European Union country to tighten its rules on foreign corporate takeovers following a series of Chinese deals giving access to Western technology and expertise. The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval. Four German firms catering to the auto industry -- FFT, Eisenmann, ZF Body Controls and Eissmann Automotive -- are currently talking to potential Chinese buyers, but do not expect political interference, the sources said.These assets are not the type of technologically critical assets that Germany wants to protect, a banker familiar with the deals said. If the state were to start interfering in these kinds of deals, that would be the end of dealmaking in Germany. FFT, a maker of manufacturing facilities for car makers owned by private equity investor Aton, has attracted first round offers from Chinese bidders such as Shanghai Electric (601727.SS) in a Morgan Stanley (MS.N)-led deal, people close to the matter said.The company may reap a valuation of roughly half a billion euros or 8 to 9 times its expected 2017 core earnings of about 60 million euros ($68.5 million). The deal is expected to come at a lower valuation than what Midea (000333.SZ) paid for robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) last year. While both groups make car production gear, FFT specializes on assembly lines but does not supply robots itself, weighing on the valuation, the people said. Family-owned paint shop maker Eisenmann has attracted two Chinese bidders, who are in the final round of a sales process organized by UBS (UBSG.S). The company, which has 70 million euros in expected 2017 core earnings may be valued at 400-500 million euros in a deal that may be signed as early as this summer, according to sources close to that deal.ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] is also in the final stages of talks with one Chinese bidder on the sale of its $1 billion Body Controls unit, which it put on the block last year, according to sources familiar with the situation.

Power utility Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA wants to be part of a Brookfield-led turnaround of Renova, two of the people said. The utility known as Cemig (CMIG4.SA) owns 34.2 percent of Renova. That stance could sink Brookfield's proposed 1.6 billion-real ($499 million) cash offer for control of Renova, the people said. Cemig plans to first sound out interest from distressed debt giant Oaktree Capital Management LP and two other unidentified funds in Renova, two of the people said. Reuters reported on Friday that Canada-based Brookfield would buy out the combined 63.5 percent that Cemig, Light SA (LIGT3.SA) and RR Participações SA have in Renova for 810 million reais. The Canadian firm would then pump an additional 800 million reais into Renova to win full management rights. Cemig, Light and Brookfield declined to comment.Snubbing Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy takeovers in Brazil in the past year, is risky for Renova since it faces a heavy repayment calendar and a fragile cash position, said one of the people, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Renova's units (RNEW11.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, extended losses on Thursday on the news. The stock shed 2.3 percent to 7.58 reais, compared with a 0.5 percent gain in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index. Cash Crunch Units are up almost 30 percent since Jan. 2, on expectations a takeover could save the company from a chronic cash shortage or even bankruptcy. Reuters first reported that Renova could be taken over on March 1. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc collapsed weeks before the latter filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. Exiting Renova would allow Cemig, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, to facilitate the refinancing of almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. This week, Chief Financial Officer Adezio Lima said the partial or full sale of Cemig's and Light's stakes in Renova could take up to 60 days. Interest in Brazil's renewable power industry is growing, especially among foreign investors who see it as a resilient play despite declining electricity consumption and a harsh recession.Additional reporting by John Tilak in Toronto and Luciano Costa in São Paulo; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Phil Berlowitz"

American Airlines CEO Doug Parker, however, said in a letter to his employees last month that We aren't particularly excited about Qatar's outreach and that it was puzzling given the U.S. carrier's very public stance on state support given to Gulf carriers.

The loan sale - representing about 7 percent of the bank's $39 billion offshore assets - comes as Chinese regulators move to reduce leverage and control potential systemic risk, including problems posed by domestic companies acquiring overseas assets. Hong Kong based CITIC Bank International has put 51 Asia offshore loans up for sale, most of which were made to companies based in mainland China, Basis Point reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter and a sale document. The loans are largely denominated in U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, maturing between 2017 to 2021. The largest loan up for sale is a $600 million chunk of a $12.7 billion syndicated financing facility backing China National Chemical Corp’s (ChemChina) $44 billion acquisition of pesticides and seeds group Syngenta AG, according the document and the sources, Basis Point said. CITIC Bank International, together with its parent China CITIC Bank, was the global coordinator and largest lender of the facility. The bank is also selling a HK$4 billion ($512 million) portion of a loan used to finance Hong Kong-listed Goldin Properties Holdings Ltd's take-private, HK$2 billion of lending to debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group and $30 million to acquisitive Chinese conglomerate Fosun, according to the document and sources. Banks typically offload portfolios in the secondary market to reduce credit and liquidity risk. Bankers in receipt of the sale document said the $2.8 billion portfolio was unusually large for the Asian secondary loan market. A Hong Kong-based spokesman for CITIC Bank International said in an email statement that the sale of the loans was part of the bank's ongoing portfolio management. The bank's liquidity maintenance ratio is well above regulatory requirements and is above peer average, he added. Scaling Back The Chinese banking regulator is cracking down following years of aggressive lending by Chinese banks, particularly to finance overseas acquisitions. Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas in 2016, ranging from movie studios to football clubs.Chinese banks' share of the Asia ex-Japan market in syndicated loans, usually used to fund acquisitions, was more than a third last year compared to about 14 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Last month, China's banking regulator ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group Co, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun, Reuters reported, without naming the banks. Several Chinese loan bankers said they were also looking to deleverage their portfolio and would be selective in lending in the second half of 2017. We have been asked to tighten our lending in the second half after making so many loans in the past few years, one Hong Kong-based senior loan banker told Basis Point.

GLP has a market value of around $9.2 billion and the deal will rank as the largest buyout in Asia by private equity firms, which are increasingly targeting bigger takeovers after raising record funds. After months of negotiations, a special committee of GLP's independent directors is aiming to finalize a deal this week with the Chinese consortium, which is led by Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group and is backed by GLP CEO Ming Mei, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the deal. GLP and the Chinese consortium declined to comment. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns a 37 percent in GLP, also declined to comment. GLP, which owns a $41 billion portfolio of industrial assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States, is benefiting from a boom in e-commerce that has fueled demand for modern logistics facilities. It counts Amazon (AMZN.O) and JD.com (JD.O) among its clients. Concerns over the transparency of the sale process and business ties of the Chinese consortium had forced some potential bidders to re-evaluate their interest, sources have said, making the auction a two-way race with Warburg Pincus and its logistics partner e-Shang Redwood. GLP has said it had taken measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. GIC last year nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business. JPMorgan was then hired by GLP as its financial adviser. GLP's shares have since soared nearly 50 percent to their highest levels in more than three years. Hopu's founder Fang Fenglei, one of China's best known dealmakers, is a GLP board member and Hopu partly owns GLP's China business.

Isola has hired investment bank Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N) to help restructure its debt, which will start coming due in 2018, said the sources, who asked not be identified because Isola's debt restructuring plans are confidential.Evercore declined to comment. Buyout firms TPG Capital LP and Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N), which own Isola, also declined to comment. Chandler, Arizona-based Isola did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move underscores the extent to which the global electronics supply chain Isola sells to has changed since it was separated in 2004 from German coal mining conglomerate RAG Aktiengesellschaft. Since then, major consumers of chips such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) have sought to reduce their supplier relationships and cut costs. Isola's earnings have faced sharp declines after stiff competition from bigger and more deep-pocketed players such as Japanese conglomerate Panasonic Corp (6752.T). Rivals such as China's Shenghyi Technology Co Ltd (600183.SS) have also made it harder to compete on price in a fragmented, low-margin market. Isola's laminates, which are used in coatings on circuit boards, are sold into the electronics industry, including in high-end consumer electronics and communications equipment. The company has seen its annual profit fall from $100 million three years ago to a projection of about $45 million for 2017, according to the sources. Isola had plans in 2011 to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering (IPO), and then use the proceeds to pay down debt. But in 2014, it withdrew its IPO plans.Isola's $250 million term loan due in 2018 was trading at a significant discount to face value this week, indicating investor concerns about repayment. The loan was trading at 64 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in June aimed at stopping the merger, arguing that the combined company would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests. The lawsuit was the latest setback for the two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November 2016 as a merger of equals that would cut their legal bills. The companies said in similar filings that the FTC lawsuit reflected an unnecessarily rigid and uninformed application of the antitrust laws to an underdeveloped, nascent industry, and largely ignore rigorous economic analysis that has revealed consistently, no matter which way it is analyzed, that prices are not likely to increase as a result of the transaction.The companies also said their deal would be good for consumers and argued that they competed for players against larger, more powerful companies in the broader and longer- running fantasy sports businesses, like ESPN (DIS.N) and Yahoo (VZ.N). DraftKings admits that fantasy sports include, but are not limited to, both season-long fantasy sports (SLFS) and DFS (daily fantasy sports), but specifically denies the characterization that SLFS and DFS are distinct, the company said in its filing.Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, which focus on single-day contests, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. The FTC has asked the court for a preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from closing the deal while it proceeds with an internal review to determine if the merger is legal. If the FTC wins a preliminary injunction, companies normally give up because deals cannot be held together during the lengthy internal process.

The reorganization of the company, nearly entirely state-owned, involves the sale of Areva's nuclear reactor business as New Areva NP to power utility EDF (EDF.PA) by the end of this year. Its uranium mining, nuclear fuel production and decommissioning activities will be transferred to a new company, NewCo. Areva and France's finance ministry also said the state would also inject 2.5 billion euros into NewCo by July 31, while Japan's MHI (7011.T) and JNFL would put in capital totaling 500 million euros by the end of the month. These capital increases, which represent an extraordinary mobilization of resources by the state, is a key component and the last phase in the restructuring of the nuclear group, before exclusive control of New Areva NP is handed over to EDF, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement. The decision in 2015 to reorganize Areva SA came after the company was hit by low demand for nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan 2011. Le Maire said the past management of Areva had been scandalous but the government was regaining confidence in its leadership. After the sale of New Areva NP to EDF and the creation of NewCo, Areva SA will be left with managing the EPR OL3 nuclear power plant construction project in Finland, a project which has been beset by a series of delays and extra costs.

Blumenthal told reporters on Capitol Hill that he requested the meeting with Makan Delrahim in the wake of a New York Times report that White House advisers battling television news station CNN mulled using a government review of AT&T;'s merger plans as leverage. Delrahim was nominated to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust at the Justice Department and is awaiting Senate confirmation.

(Reuters) - An attorney for Elliott Management on Wednesday complained to a bankruptcy court judge that the owner of Texas's largest power distribution business did not provide the investment fund with information needed to line up financing for its offer of more than $18 billion to buy the company. Instead, Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt majority owner of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, struck a deal this month to sell its ownership of the business to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) for $9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $18.1 billion.A lawyer for Elliott Management, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, told the court that the fund has enough debt in Oncor's parent, Energy Future, to block the Berkshire deal.The fund has argued that its own $18.5 billion Oncor deal would be better for creditors. Gregg Galardi, Elliott's lawyer, said potential sources of financing for a rival bid had contacted Elliott, a $32 billion fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, but Energy Future had ignored requests for information to help structure a deal. We need actual cooperation, he said. Galardi also noted that Energy Future had not run an auction. Chad Husnick, who represents Energy Future, countered that Elliott had not signed a non-disclosure agreement with Oncor and said Energy Future would not shop its Oncor stake when Elliott had no committed financing. My response is, show me the money and we’ll consider it, he said. Husnick also told the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the Berkshire plan could be confirmed. Two previous deals for Oncor, with Hunt Consolidated Inc and another with NextEra Energy (NEE.N), were rejected by Texas's Public Utility Commission after the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Husnick said the Berkshire proposal has already been discussed with PUC staff. He said Energy Future anticipates quick regulatory approval and then confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court, an approach that Judge Christopher Sontchi said he supported. Elliott has estimated creditors will be repaid around 24 cents on the dollar under the Berkshire proposal, compared to 80 cents under the deal NextEra Energy that was blocked by Texas regulators. A hearing on the schedule for reviewing the Berkshire plan was set for July 26. Energy Future has been in bankruptcy since 2014, filing after a consortium of private equity firms bought it for about $44 billion.

The move makes Guitar Center the latest example of a brick-and-mortar retailer facing financial distress, as its stores are relegated to showrooms by consumers looking for bargains on the internet and in big box retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). In addition to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), musicians can now buy their instruments online from Sweetwater Sound Inc, as well as directly from guitar makers themselves, such as Fender Musical Instruments. Guitar Center, majority-owned by private equity firm Ares Management LP (ARES.N), has been having conversations with investment banks and law firms about hiring advisers to help address its capital structure, with $615 million in secured debt coming due in 2019, the people said this week.The sources asked not to be identified because the company's plans to cut its debt have not been made public. Ares declined to comment.The musical instrument industry grew 9 percent to $7.1 billion in retail sales over the past five years, but remains well below its 2005 peak of $7.7 billion, according to data from The Music Trades magazine. The industry's challenges have been compounded as the newest generation of teens has shifted its focus from guitars to consoles, smartphones and sports. The electric guitar has been virtually absent from the Top 20 music charts in the past five years. Based in Westlake Village, California, Guitar Center has more than 280 stores across the United States. Its sister brand Music & Arts runs 150 stores focused on band and orchestral equipment for schools and educators.It has sought to draw shoppers into its stores by offering music lessons, instrument rentals and free workshops. Guitar Center began in 1959 as a store selling home organs in Hollywood. In the 1980s, the company started its Rockwalk on Sunset Boulevard, a hall of fame that pays homage to musicians including Alanis Morissette, Aerosmith and Van Halen.After a period of explosive growth, it went public in the 1990s. Guitar Center's debt is trading at a significant discount to its face value. Its $325 million in unsecured bonds due in 2020 are trading at about 59 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company's $615 million in secured bonds due in 2019 are trading at about 87 cents on the dollar.Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc said in April that it did not expect that Guitar Center will generate enough free cash flow in the next 12 to 18 months to materially reduce its debt and improve leverage. This would not be the first time Guitar Center would undergo a debt restructuring. In 2014, Ares, which was the company's creditor at the time, swapped its debt in the retailer for a controlling equity stake, cutting the retailer's debt by about $500 million.

Generali and fellow insurers are struggling to pay guaranteed returns to clients because of record-low interest rates. Combined with more stringent European capital rules, these have prompted some to offload life insurance operations. The Generali Leben portfolio would mark the largest closed book sale ever. Dutch insurer Aegon sold a 9 billion pound book of closed UK life business last year and Britain's Standard Life has said it is open to the sale of its 16 billion pound closed annuity portfolio. Given the complexity of Generali Leben, and the necessary approval from financial watchdog Bafin for any transaction, no deal is expected to emerge quickly, the sources said.Generali may also opt to keep it if its price expectations are not met, they added. Ratings agency Fitch said on Wednesday that the outlook for German life insurance was negative, reflecting the pressures from low investment yields. Financial services groups specializing in the run-off of life insurance by acquiring policies until their expiry and aim to turn a profit by measures such as cutting administrative costs, are vying for the Generali Leben portfolio. Among the three big life business units of the group (AachenMuenchner, Cosmosdirekt and Generali Leben) Generali Leben is more exposed to the low interest rates risk, the Generali spokesman said.One of the sources said that the insurer is hoping for a purchase price of 900 million euros for the portfolio, but that bidders value the business at closer to 400-600 million euros. Only a handful of smaller portfolios of the roughly 90 German life insurers have changed hands, including those of Arag Leben, Delta Lloyd, Basler Leben, Heidelberger Leben and Skandia. German firms such as Viridium - owned by Cinven and Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE) - and Fosun-backed Frankfurter Leben have shown interest in the Generali closed book, as has Bermuda-based Athene (ATH.N), the sources said.These companies declined to comment. After fending off a possible takeover from Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo earlier this year, Generali announced plans to leave markets where it lacks scale. The group aims to raise about 1 billion euros by selling businesses in 13 to 15 countries across the world, Chief Executive Philippe Donnet has said.  The insurer's roadmap includes selling operations in a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, where it is working with BNP and Deutsche Bank, respectively, sources told Reuters. Generali is also looking for new owners for subsidiaries in Portugal, Colombia, Ecuador and Panama, these sources said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-m-a-idUSKBN19W2R6","Germany sets EU tone with tighter curbs on foreign takeovers","","Jul 12 2017","Germany has become the first European Union country to tighten its rules on foreign corporate takeovers, following a series of Chinese deals giving access to Western technology and expertise.","LONDON/BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany has become the first European Union country to tighten its rules on foreign corporate takeovers, following a series of Chinese deals giving access to Western technology and expertise. The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval in a bid to protect critical infrastructure, including power grids and hospitals. We remain one of the most open economies in the world, but we also need to take fair competitive conditions into consideration, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said in a statement on Wednesday. We owe that to our companies. They often compete with countries whose economies are not as open as ours, she added. The move reflects pressure across Europe to limit takeovers by Chinese state-backed groups of prized European assets. The purchase last year of German robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) by Chinese company Midea (000333.SZ) raised concerns that China was gaining too much access to key technologies while shielding its own companies from foreign takeovers. State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, Beijing's biggest overseas acquisition to date, has increased pressure in Europe to curb foreign takeovers in strategically important sectors. At his first EU summit in June, French President Emmanuel Macron teamed up with Italy and Germany to call for a European mechanism preventing unwanted takeovers.To introduce more scrutiny in deal-making, the 28 EU leaders called on the Commission to analyze foreign investments in sectors such as energy, banking and technology, where China seeks Europe's technological know-how.A spokeswoman at the Commission said President Jean-Claude Juncker had set up a dedicated Commissioners' Group on Trade and Harnessing Globalisation to elaborate on possible actions for the President's State of the Union speech in September.We take note of the newly published German decree, she said, adding the Commission was aware of the concerns related to foreign investment in strategic sectors.Equal Terms Reciprocal access has emerged as a key issue alarming European executives and politicians, who have complained about a lack of similar openings in China.State-owned Chinese firms will continue to look for M&A; opportunities across the globe. But one thing that needs to change is reciprocity, said Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A; at JPMorgan.Western boards are wondering if China will allow more foreign investment in Chinese companies. I think China understands the notion of reciprocity. But China has so far been using its antitrust regime to discourage Western buyers from taking over Chinese firms, and lack of transparency and complex ownership structures have also proved a major hurdle. The EU has long allowed countries to bar takeovers on national security grounds. Earlier this year, the German economics ministry withdrew approval for China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund to buy chip equipment maker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE), citing security concerns. Under the new German rules, operators of infrastructure companies should be better protected from investors from outside the EU. In addition, the government will be able to take twice as long - four months - in reviewing such deals. German industry association BDI and some politicians close to Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the reforms. The BDI rejects a law on foreign trade that increasingly blocks investments, said BDI board member Stefan Mair. We demand that Germany presents itself clearly as a country that is open to foreign investors. Bankers also said the rules could backfire. The new regulation adds a layer of complexity to cross-border transactions into Germany, said Goldman Sachs partner Alexander Mayer.The risk is that valuations of certain assets could be impacted in a negative way if investors fear that the government wants to protect German companies from takeovers, he added. Balancing Act Other European countries including Britain and the Netherlands are planning to give governments power to intervene in takeovers of key infrastructure and pausing bids for a period of time to protect national security. British Prime Minister Theresa May's legislative agenda included tightening laws on company takeovers and ensuring any foreign group buying important infrastructure did not undermine security or essential services. Yet May and other EU leaders need to strike a fine balance between protectionism and the growing need for foreign investments to sustain their economies. Italy is among EU countries that has seen some of its national champions, such as tire maker Pirelli, sold to Chinese firms. While seeking to protect its companies by trying to force corporate raiders to disclose what their ultimate intentions are, it can't afford to close the door on Chinese trade. Any Europe-wide mechanism against foreign takeovers could give the EU similar powers to the U.S. where the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) considers the national interest and security ramifications of investment by overseas companies in American ones. Last year, CFIUS blocked the $2.8 billion sale of Philips' components lighting division Lumileds to an investor consortium led by GO Scale Capital of China.China's voracious appetite for overseas acquisitions propelled Asia to the forefront of global deal-making for the first time last year, with Chinese direct investment in the European Union jumping by 77 percent to more than 35 billion euros ($39.9 billion), according to the Rhodium Group. But the pace of foreign investments is now slowing as Beijing has introduced a new capital control regime and doing deals in the U.S. has become increasingly difficult following the election of President Donald Trump.

It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe's leading hub for the nascent fintech sector.The investment dwarfs the 19.5 million pounds ($25 million) raised by London-based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year. Revolut, which has around 700,000 customers, over 400,000 of them based in Britain, provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard (MA.N) is accepted.Other start-ups, such as Monzo and Germany's N26, offer similar products, but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates, zero-fee international money transfers, and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app-based accounts. Revolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian-born Nikolay Storonsky, who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for Credit Suisse. If he were starting the company now, as Britain heads out of the European Union, Storonsky would still choose London as its base, he said.I don’t see any problems with Brexit, he told Reuters. London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe, (and) in terms of regulation, it’s a great place to be. Some fintech firms are worried about losing passporting rights, which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other. But Storonsky, whose firm has a UK e-money license, said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU. Storonsky, 34, said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy.I just don't like banks, he said. They're so bureaucratic, with so many managers not really doing anything ...

The court move means Metro can proceed with plans to list shares in its wholesale and hypermarkets food business on Thursday, while shares in the consumer electronics business - renamed Ceconomy - will trade independently for the first time. Metro, a sprawling conglomerate, has spent several years restructuring and selling non-core businesses such as its Kaufhof department stores, to focus on its cash-and-carry business and Media-Saturn electronics chain. Fierce competition from Amazon (AMZN.O) is seen as likely to trigger more mergers in the consumer electronics sector after French retailer Fnac (FNAC.PA) bought Darty last year. Ceconomy will drive the transformation and consolidation of consumer electronics in Europe in a dynamic way, Chief Executive Pieter Haas told reporters on a conference call. Haas said he expected the pace of consolidation to increase in the coming years due to the need for massive investment in areas such as digital price tags, loyalty schemes and big data processing as ecommerce shakes up retailing. In May Ceconomy reported a loss due to heavy investment. FILE PHOTO: A worker arranges vegetables inside a newly opened wholesale store of Metro Cash & Carry India, at Sarkhej on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India June 13, 2017.Amit Dave/File PhotoCeconomy is Europe's biggest consumer electronics group, ahead of Britain's Dixons Carphone (DC.L), running more than 1,000 stores in 15 European countries, with sales of 22 billion euros ($25 billion) in the 2015/16 financial year. Metro's cash-and carry business that serves independent traders, hotels and restaurants is already an active acquirer, buying Pro a Pro from Belgian retail and wholesale group Colruyt last year and Singapore-based Classic Fine Foods in 2015. Metro's wholesale business has 751 stores in 25 countries. Along with Real hypermarkets in Germany, Metro's food unit had 2015-16 sales of 37 billion euros. Metro hopes the split will trigger a revaluation of the stock as Metro has traded at a discount to other pure wholesale retailers such as Sysco (SYY.N) and Britain's Booker (BOK.L). Shares in Metro, which have sagged on uncertainty about the court proceedings, were up 1.5 percent to 29.64 euros by 1142 GMT.Most of Metro's shareholders already approved the plan to split in February, but some, including Erich Kellerhals, the founder of Media-Saturn, launched a legal challenge.Kellerhals has been at odds with Metro over its management of Media-Saturn for years. Kellerhals' Convergenta investment firm said it would actively defend its rights in the new structure but Ceconomy's Haas said the split should limit his influence in the future. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne expects the current share price of around 29 euros to be split into about 18.50 euros for the wholesale and food group and 10.50 for Ceconomy at the opening auction on Thursday.

Talks with a Japanese government-backed group chosen by Toshiba as a preferred bidder for its chip business have stalled due to what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that its financing be done via convertible bonds. In the first public acknowledgement that it wants a stake in the world's No. 2 NAND producer, SK Hynix chief executive Park Sung-wook told reporters that it is continuing to negotiate the purchase and will not drop its equity plan. The preferred bidder group also includes the state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan, the Development Bank of Japan and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital. But the stand-off resulted on Tuesday in Toshiba saying it was again talking with suitors Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) and Foxconn (2317.TW) due to the lack of progress. The embattled conglomerate does not want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip unit - a stance it has taken to satisfy a government that wants the technology to remain under domestic control. Some Japanese officials had hoped SK Hynix may back down from its demand for a stake, sources have said.Hit by massive cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, Toshiba needs billions of dollars in fresh loans to tide it over before it can complete the $18 billion sale of the memory chip unit. It sold its medical equipment business to Canon Inc for $6 billion last year and its Landis+Gyr smart meters unit aims to raise up to $2.5 billion, but that will not be enough to plug the hole in its balance sheet. And although Japanese banking sources said on Tuesday that Toshiba has regained access to a $6 billion credit line, lenders have also imposed tough conditions.Toshiba has told creditors it will need 1 trillion yen in fresh loans during the current financial year through March, banking sources have said previously. Sources said Toshiba's banks, which include Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (8316.T) and Mizuho Bank (8411.T), allowed it to withdraw 100 billion yen ($880 million) in loans late last month but must seek permission every week to extend the loan, despite a previously-agreed commitment line of 680 billion yen. Another obstacle in the chip unit auction has been Toshiba's strained ties with Western Digital, which bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year.Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. The banking sources said they were worried the conflict could end up scuppering the sale as well as the chip business' long-term prospects. One said he hoped that Toshiba and Western Digital would work to resolve their conflict.Reporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Se Young Lee in Seoul and Taro Fuse and Taiga Uranaka in Tokyo; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Alexander Smith"

Mighty Corp, which has been charged with avoiding 37.88 billion pesos in tax payments, has offered to pay the Philippines government 25 billion pesos.It will fund the tax settlement with a 45 billion peso sale of its assets to JT International Philippines, a local subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, the Philippines' Department of Finance said in a statement, quoting a letter from Mighty President Oscar Barrientos. A Japan Tobacco spokeswoman in Tokyo confirmed the company was in talks with Mighty to buy its manufacturing and distribution assets, but declined further comment.Officials at Mighty, the second-largest tobacco company in the Philippines, were not immediately available for comment. Japan Tobacco, the world's third-biggest tobacco company, said in May it was looking for mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets such as southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, as it diversifies away from its home market. It is also widely seen as a potential suitor for Britain's Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Jefferies analysts said on Wednesday the purchase of Mighty did nothing to change that, given the small size of Mighty.This further highlights their appetite for a deal and perhaps the urgency with which JT knows it needs to act to address structural pressures and close the gap on peers, Jefferies said. The potential acquisition by Japan Tobacco, which sells the Winston, Mild Seven and Camel brands in the Philippines, would help it to challenge the dominance of PMFTC Inc, a joint venture of the Philippines unit of Philip Morris International (PM.N) and unlisted Fortune Tobacco Corp, in the southeast Asian country's cigarette market.Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales in Manila and Taiga Uranaka in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London; Editing by David Goodman and Mark Potter"

The deal includes an initial consideration of $947 million and additional payments of up to $285 million between 2018-2025, subject to gas price and production, Shell said on Wednesday. The Anglo-Dutch company is on track to sell assets of about $30 billion by 2018 to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group. Shell has also been working to mitigate climate change risks that have upset some investors. The development of the Corrib gas field, discovered in 1996, has faced protests since 2005 by residents concerned that the laying of a high-pressure pipeline to bring gas onshore could pollute their water supply. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, and Vermilion Energy Inc will become the new operator of the gas field off the north-west coast of Ireland. For CPPIB, the deal is another step in its pursuit to diversify beyond domestic markets. The fund's most recent deal in the energy sector was to invest up to $1 billion to acquire U.S. oil and gas assets. The transaction will result in an impairment charge of around $350 million in Q2 2017, Shell said. The transaction, which is subject to partner and regulatory approval, is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, the company said. Norway's Statoil, which owns a 36.5 per cent stake in the Corrib gas field venture, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In June, RHB Bank (RHBC.KL) and AmBank said they were starting merger talks, in Malaysia's biggest ever banking deal. As part of the all-share deal, valued at about $9 billion, RHB is looking to acquire AmBank and the two banks are in exclusive talks until the end of August. ANZ's stake is expected to be roughly 10 percent in the merged entity. Sources said ANZ is in talks to sell that stake to Malaysian retirement fund KWAP, which already owns small stakes in both RHB and AmBank. Both firms have agreed in principle to the deal at a price equivalent to one time book value of AmBank, said one of the sources. KWAP has always had an aspiration to hold a significant investment in a financial institution. KWAP had considered purchasing part of ANZ's stake two years ago but was not agreeable to the pricing, said the source. Last week, Malaysia's Star newspaper quoted KWAP CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad as saying the fund was keen on buying ANZ's stake after the proposed RHB and AmBank merger. KWAP and AmBank declined to comment. We will decline to comment on market speculation, an ANZ spokesman said.ANZ's stake is also drawing interest from another Malaysian institutional investor, said the source. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were private. RHB has indicated to analysts that it would pay AmBank shareholders a one-time multiple of the latter's book value.1mdb Shadow ANZ wanted to exit the stake partly after AmBank was dragged into a political scandal linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and Prime Minister Najib Razak, sources have previously said. In 2015, AmBank was slapped with a 53.7 million ringgit fine by Malaysian regulators for breaching financial regulations. Najib has been buffeted by allegations of graft, in particular by revelations of the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into his AmBank account in 2013. The Prime Minister has denied any wrongdoing. If the RHB-AmBank merger wins the approval of shareholders, the stakes of other key shareholders will also decline in the merged entity. Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, with a 17.8 percent stake in RHB, would hold 10.3 percent, according to a note by Maybank Research. The Abu Dhabi firm, which has been linked to the 1MDB scandal, merged into Mubadala last year. A separate source close to Mubadala said the firm wants to eventually sell Aabar's stake in RHB, but will wait until it gets a fair price.

Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, and Booker announced the cash and shares deal in January and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally started a phase 1 review in May. Last month, Tesco and Booker asked the CMA to move swiftly to a more in-depth phase 2 examination. The CMA said on Wednesday it believed that in over 350 local areas where there was currently an overlap between Tesco shops and Booker-supplied independent grocery retailers, or so-called symbol stores, shoppers could face worse terms when buying products. It said there were concerns that if the deal was cleared there was potential for Booker to reduce the wholesale services or terms it offers the stores it currently supplies, in order to drive customers to their local Tesco. The figure of 350 areas under scrutiny was lower than initially speculated by analysts and media when the deal was announced. Analysts at HSBC noted that previous reviews by the CMA, such as of Booker's purchase of Irish retail and wholesaler Musgraves in 2015, suggested that barriers to switching by symbol groups to alternative wholesalers were low.This offers some hope that once an in-depth review is carried out, remedies (required by the CMA) may be even lower than the initial 350, they said. HSBC has a buy stance on Tesco. Booker supplies services to over 5,000 symbol stores, operating under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. It also supplies restaurants such as Wagamama and Carluccio's and operates the Makro cash and carry business. FILE PHOTO: A branded sign is displayed outside of a Booker Wholesale store in London, Britain January 27, 2017.Neil Hall/File PhotoTesco runs more than 3,000 stores across Britain. The CMA said other concerns were raised and considered in the initial probe, but it had not found it necessary to conclude on all of these given the referral. The regulator will now assess whether the deal could reduce competition by conducting further research and analysis as well as seeking views and evidence from all those potentially affected by the deal. The CMA's in-depth phase 2 investigation lasts 24 weeks. Its final report will be published before Christmas, following an earlier provisional findings report. The transaction will be cleared if the phase 2 inquiry does not find it will reduce competition. If competition is seen to be affected, the CMA can either seek remedies or block the deal. Tesco sees the deal as a new source of growth given Booker's role as a major distributor to the catering industry. Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the transaction, saying it was overpaying and a distraction from its turnaround plan. Tesco and Booker said they were pleased the CMA had accepted their fast track request. This merger has always been about growth, and we remain convinced that it will bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers and colleagues, a Tesco spokesman said. We look forward to continuing our constructive engagement with the CMA, added a Booker spokeswoman. Shares in Tesco were down 0.2 percent at 171 pence at 1137 GMT, while Booker shares were down 0.5 percent at 189 pence.

It is not wise for the U.S. to close its doors in industries that are declining in profit ... the United States should step forward and develop new technology areas, said Hu. U.S. regulators have called for heightened scrutiny of Chinese chip acquisitions leading to a chill in overseas M&A; activity by Chinese chip firms, with a number of high-level deals failing to gain approval. In December the Obama administration blocked China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of German semiconductor firm Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) over national security concerns related to Aixtron's U.S. assets. In March China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC resubmitted a $1.3 billion bid for U.S. chip firm Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) after the initial review period expired. More than 20 U.S. Congress members signed a letter to the U.S. Treasury in December calling for a block on the Lattice deal, saying it could disrupt the U.S. military supply chain and increase reliance on foreign chipmakers. The United States should not be afraid of other countries catching up, Hu said, adding that China is seeking technologies the United States has already developed in the past two decades and Chinese investment could boot profitability in the sector. Washington recently sought to strengthen the role of CFIUS, the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. U.S. politicians and lawmakers have called for the committee to increase deal scrutiny in areas where China is seeking to build world-leading technology, including artificial intelligence.China will release a national artificial intelligence plan in the coming months, following a similar roadmap released by the United States, Hu said.Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by David Evans"

VMH also has sales offices in Houston and Luxembourg. Last year, investments in zinc and byproducts represented 11 percent of Votorantim's capital spending of about $3 billion. Those investments included efforts to extend the working life of the Vazante mine in Brazil for another 10 years. Proceeds may also come in handy for Votorantim, Brazil's largest diversified industrial group, to grow in energy and other core sectors while cutting debt, which stands now at about 15 billion reais ($4.6 billion).

Rothschild is in a strong position for an advisory role to the deal that could raise $1.5 to $2 billion for ADNOC, sources told Reuters. Beyond the Gulf region, oil companies are looking to raise capital and boost valuations in an era of cheap oil from listings or sales of retail units. Plans to list some of ADNOC's services also come as other Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, have embarked on privatising energy assets. The listing of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's (ADNOC) Distribution business, which manages petrol stations as well as convenience stores across the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is planned before the end of the year, one of the sources told Reuters. The company has a total number of 460 petrol stations after the opening up of several new ones since the start of the year, it said in a statement on Wednesday. ADNOC's listing could stir the UAE's lackluster IPO scene from its recent slumber. There have been only two initial public offerings (IPOs) so far in 2017 in the UAE, raising $348.5 million, and none at all last year, Thomson Reuters data shows. Other oil companies looking to raise money from listings of retail units include China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, which is planning to list its retail unit in Hong Kong and Thailand's biggest energy company PTT which is examining a proposal to list its retail business. The pitching process for the ADNOC deal is under way after the unlisted group announced this week that it is looking to float some of its services businesses and enter tie-ups with global investors to help it create new revenue streams and secure more market access. Ten banks have been invited to pitch for a role in the IPO, one of the sources said. ADNOC declined to confirm details of the pitching process, but a spokesman told Reuters central to ADNOC's new approach is the more active management of its portfolio of assets and businesses. ADNOC is therefore considering the IPO of minority stakes of some of its services businesses and we will update the market on its plans in due course, the spokesman said. Spokespeople for JPMorgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Rothschild declined to comment. First Abu Dhabi Bank did not respond to a request for comment. ADNOC has no plans to list the holding company.

Favorable royalty terms are crucial for Spotify to attain profitability and to make it a viable long-term holding for investors. The company reported a 349 million euro ($400 million) operating loss, a 47 percent increase on a year earlier, even as revenue grew 50 percent to 2.93 billion euros. In April, it signed a multi-year licensing deal with Vivendi's Universal Music Group, with a similar two-week release window for new albums and a break on the royalties Spotify pays Universal. It also signed up digital agency Merlin, on behalf of more than 20,000 independent labels. Last year, Universal held a 28.9 percent share of global music label revenue, Sony Music generated 22.4 percent and Warner 17.4 percent. Independent labels made up the remaining 31.3 percent, MIDiA Research data showed. Spotify has fended off competition from rival Apple Music, with nearly double the number of paying subscribers.In March, Spotify said it had more than 50 million paying subscribers and 140 million active users, including free listeners. Apple reported 27 million music subscribers last month, up from 20 million in December. The company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions, according to analysts. Spotify declined to comment. Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group did not respond to requests for immediate comment.

The company is considering a valuation range of between $3 billion to $5 billion, with a final decision on the size of IPO and its overall value depending on market conditions at the time of the deal, added the person, who couldn't be named because details of the transaction aren't public. Razer filed for the IPO late last month in a deal that Thomson Reuters publication IFR said could raise around $400 million. Razer declined to comment. The company was founded in 2005 by Min-Liang Tan and Robert Krakoff and has grown from producing a gaming mouse as its initial product to manufacturing laptops worth almost $4,000. In 2016 it bought assets from a company previously known as THX Ltd, which was founded by George Lucas, and this year it acquired certain assets and intellectual property from mobile phone manufacturer Nextbit Systems. The acquisitions are expected to help the company launch new products in coming years, including a mobile gaming device, a separate person familiar with Razer's plans said. Razer had revenue of $392.1 million in 2016, compared with $319.7 million in 2015, while losses widened to $59.6 million last year from $20.4 million over the same period. The company has raised funds from a series of investors including Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] and venture capital funds IDG-Accel China Capital and Binary Capital, as well as U.S. venture capital investor Joe Lonsdale, Indonesian tycoons Robert Budi Hartono and Bambang Hartono and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, according to the IPO filing.

The Russian telecoms market has become saturated in recent years, with stalling revenue growth prompting operators to cut handset prices and tariffs to win subscribers. That has led to steady declines in profitability and a shift in focus to customer retention rather than contract sales. Megafon, part of billionaire Alisher Usmanov's diversified USM holding, and Vimpelcom, a subsidiary of Amsterdam-based Veon, said they will split Euroset, with Megafon assuming complete ownership of the business and Vimpelcom acquiring half of its retail outlets. The transaction will allow Megafon and Veon to pursue their independent retail strategies and optimise mobile distribution in Russia, Megafon CEO Sergei Soldatenkov said in a statement. The deal follows the move by MTS, Russia's biggest mobile operator, to end its partnership with Euroset and another retailer, Svyaznoy, to focus on its own network. In an environment where maintaining loyalty of high-paying subscribers prevails over new subscriber additions, monobrand (retail) networks can be more attractive than those deemed independent, Uralsib analysts wrote in a note.

The Shenzhen-based insurer plans to use the acquired technology and know-how to grow its business in China, Jonathan Larsen, Ping An Group's chief innovation officer and chairman of the fund, told Reuters on Tuesday. The primary rationale for the fund is strategic...to find capabilities, ideas, business models and technologies that can be valuable to Ping An, he told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Ping An launched the Hong Kong-based Global Voyager Fund in early May as the sole investor, but did not give details of which type of start-up companies it wanted to buy, or where it would look for assets. The fund will allocate 30 percent of the capital to growth companies that are at least three years old and have been through the early-stage challenges, with a single investment size of $10 million to $30 million, Larsen said.Another 30 percent will be deployed to bigger firms with a single investment size of between $30 million and $100 million, while a further eight to 10 percent will be invested in early-stage companies via partner funds.The rest will be used for special investment opportunities such as buyouts, said Larsen, formerly the global head of retail banking and mortgages at Citigroup, who joined Ping An in May.He added that although Ping An's customer franchise is overwhelmingly Chinese, the group may follow in the footsteps of the country's largest financial institutions. We are at a point where we can very selectively contemplate international opportunities. And the fund could play a role in that mostly through partnerships, he said. Editing by Susan Thomas"

Last year, Valeo announced its takeover of FTE Automotive for 819 million euros ($939 million).

Hong Kong based CITIC Bank International has put 51 Asia offshore loans up for sale, most of which were made to companies based in mainland China, Basis Point reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter and a sale document. The loans are largely denominated in U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, maturing between 2017 to 2021. The largest loan up for sale is a $600 million chunk of a $12.7 billion syndicated financing facility backing China National Chemical Corp’s (ChemChina) $44 billion acquisition of pesticides and seeds group Syngenta AG, according the document and the sources, Basis Point said. CITIC Bank International, together with its parent China CITIC Bank, was the global coordinator and largest lender of the facility. The bank is also selling a HK$4 billion ($512 million) portion of a loan used to finance Hong Kong-listed Goldin Properties Holdings Ltd's take-private, HK$2 billion of lending to debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group and $30 million to acquisitive Chinese conglomerate Fosun, according to the document and sources.Basis Point was not able to ascertain the reason for the sale but banks typically offload portfolios in the secondary market to reduce credit and liquidity risk. Bankers in receipt of the sale document said the $2.8 billion portfolio was unusually large for the Asian secondary loan market. A Hong Kong-based spokesman for CITIC Bank International declined to comment. Scaling Back The Chinese banking regulator is cracking down following years of aggressive lending by Chinese banks, particularly to finance overseas acquisitions. Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas in 2016, ranging from movie studios to football clubs.Chinese banks' share of the Asia ex-Japan market in syndicated loans, usually used to fund acquisitions, was more than a third last year compared to about 14 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Last month, China's banking regulator ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group Co, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun, Reuters reported, without naming the banks. Several Chinese loan bankers said they were also looking to deleverage their portfolio and would be selective in lending in the second half of 2017. We have been asked to tighten our lending in the second half after making so many loans in the past few years, one Hong Kong-based senior loan banker told Basis Point.

The Japanese conglomerate confirmed it was in talks with suitors, but did not name them, noting it had been unable to reach an agreement by a self-imposed June 28 deadline with its preferred bidder - a group that includes state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS). A representative for Western Digital declined to comment, and a representative for Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), was not immediately available for comment. Talks with the preferred consortium have stalled over what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that it helps fund a deal through convertible bonds - a step that could eventually give it an equity interest in the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Toshiba doesn't want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip business - a stance it has taken to satisfy a Japanese government keen to keep Toshiba's technology under domestic control. Toshiba told its creditor banks at a meeting on Tuesday that it had begun talks with alternative bidders because talks with the consortium had stalled, the banking sources said. They didn't want to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital Corporation hard drive is pictured here in Encinitas, California April 19, 2011.Mike Blake/File PhotoToshiba had no option but to say it's in talks with other suitors because the preferred consortium is falling through, said another official involved in the talks, who also requested anonymity as those negotiations are sensitive. Toshiba needs to sell its chip business to plug a hole in its balance sheet by the fiscal year-end in March, to avoid an automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo's stock market. The 140-year-old laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate was still recovering from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse in December.Sources have said that INCJ and DBJ, said to be wary of SK Hynix, could back a deal with Western Digital. Toshiba executives, though, have been reluctant to consider a deal with Western Digital, with sources saying ties between the two companies have been strained since Western Digital bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year. Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. In July 7 court documents, Western Digital said it matched rival bidders' offers to buy the flash memory unit - though the actual dollar figure of the bid was redacted.

The deal is the latest and most high-profile transaction to be refiled this year with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a secretive government panel which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks. Ant Financial and MoneyGram refiled after they were unable to secure clearance from CFIUS within the maximum time of 75 days that is awarded for assessing applications, the sources said on Tuesday.Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days for the companies to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. We are not commenting on the CFIUS process, but we are continuing to work with the various regulatory agencies and remain focused on closing the transaction by the end of the year, Ant Financial said in a statement.MoneyGram declined to comment. A CFIUS refile does not necessarily mean that a deal will be rejected, although it does indicate increased government scrutiny. More deals have had to be refiled with CFIUS following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump in January, as several key positions at several government departments remain vacant or have taken too long to be filled. CFIUS did not respond to a request for comment. CFIUS had accepted notices of more than 120 transactions as of June 23, on pace to set a record, according to estimates by law firm Covington & Burling LLP. By comparison, CFIUS had received notices of just 97 transactions in all of 2013. Ant Financial finalized its deal to buy Dallas-based MoneyGram in April, after it sweetened its bid by over a third to beat a rival offer from U.S.-based Euronet Worldwide Inc (EEFT.O). MoneyGram's global remittance channels for sending money overseas would help Ant Financial, formerly known as Alipay, build a cross-border network after a string of recent investments in Asia. Some U.S. lawmakers, including Republican Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, have written to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who also serves as chairman of CFIUS, to express concern that Ant Financial's acquisition of MoneyGram could pose national security threats, arguing that the information of U.S. citizens, including military personnel, could be compromised. Ant Financial has said that MoneyGram's data infrastructure will remain in the United States, with personal information encrypted or held in secure facilities on U.S. soil. It has also pointed to existing U.S. regulations that call for such protections.CFIUS approved a previous deal by Ant Financial, its acquisition last year of Kansas City-based EyeVerify, the company behind a mobile eye verification technology.In addition to CFIUS, at least 46 U.S. states must have granted money transmitter licenses before the deal closes.

Ryanair was 53.6 percent owned by EU nationals, including UK investors in 2016, according to the airline. And Michael O'Leary said around 20 percent of Ryanair's shareholders are UK-based. The carrier has already been carrying out share buybacks to return cash to shareholders.Ownership post Brexit is a real issue, O'Leary told a hearing in the European Parliament. It might help me to accelerate the share buyback if UK shareholders are forced to sell.Like other European airlines, Ryanair has clauses in its articles of association that mean it can force non-EU shareholders to sell their shares in order to ensure that EU investors retain the majority. He reiterated concerns that unless a deal is agreed for Brexit then flights between Britain and the remaining EU 27 countries could be grounded.There is not a legal mechanism on which airlines can operate in a 'hard Brexit, no deal' outcome. There will simply be no flights, he said, adding that Ryanair would start cancelling flights six months before the March 2019 date when Britain is due to leave the EU with or without a deal. Aviation is not covered by World Trade Organisation rules which would apply to other industries should Britain fail to agree a deal by March 2019. Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), said he did not agree with O'Leary's assessment and that he believed there would be a solution. He called on the UK to agree a liberal air transport agreement with the EU. One suggestion is that in the absence of a deal on aviation by March 2019 EU national governments could revert to the old bilateral agreements with the UK governing air traffic rights. O'Leary said, however, that individual EU member states were unlikely to be allowed to negotiate bilaterals independently. Reporting by Julia Fioretti and Victoria Bryan; Editing by Greg Mahlich"

It also highlights the challenges of a rapidly-changing sector marked by new competition from providers of on-demand Internet streaming media such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), and the aggressive push in France of telecoms and cable group Altice (ATCA.AS) into sports broadcast rights.Under the enhanced cooperation, Orange will in coming months distribute Canal Plus's French channels direct to ultra fast broadband customers, the firm said, without giving a price at which it would be offered. It is the first time any entity other than Canal Plus has been able to charge directly for Canal Plus-owned TV content. It's the most attractive Canal Plus offer in France, the pay TV's chief executive Maxime Saada said. Canal Plus also has a distribution partnership with Orange's rival Iliad (ILD.PA). Orange boss Richard told reporters there were 900,000 Orange customers who also subscribed to Canal Plus, adding that the company aimed to double this number by 2020 via the new deal, which includes a significant guaranteed minimum order value. There's obviously a guaranteed minimum that is binding for us and Canal Plus, Richard said, without providing any figure. It's an ambitious project, so the guaranteed minimum matches (this ambition). Orange Content, the new specialist unit within the group, would also consider acquiring distribution rights. Earlier this year, Orange said it was interested in working with Canal Plus on acquiring sports rights rather than trying to buy a stake in the pay TV business.

The deal with privately held Bruin E&P; Partners LLC focuses Halcón on the most-active area in the U.S. oil industry and marks a stunning turnaround for Chief Executive Floyd Wilson, who formed the company in 2011 before having to usher it through bankruptcy in 2016 after oil prices plunged. The news sent Halcón shares up more than 35 percent in morning trading. The deal also highlights the ability of U.S. shale producers to survive and reinvent themselves, despite sliding crude prices in the past two years. The sale of our Williston Basin operated assets transforms Halcón into a single-basin company focused on the Delaware Basin where we have more than 41,000 net acres, Wilson said in a statement. Houston-based Halcón will sell its operated North Dakota assets, which produce about 29,000 barrels per day (bpd). Halcón will keep its non-operated interest in wells across the state and said it may sell them in the future. After the sale, Halcón will produce about 7,500 bpd and run two drilling rigs in the Permian. By the end of the year, Halcón expects to pump about 13,000 bpd. The deal is expected to close by August. If it collapses, Halcón would pay Bruin $42 million. Bruin E&P; Partners, which is backed by private equity firm Arclight Capital Partners LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Halcón entered the Permian in January in several deals worth more than $1.2 billion, acquiring acreage in the western part of the region known as the Delaware Basin. Focusing on the Permian could help Wilson achieve his long-held dream of selling Halcón to the highest bidder. Investors and analysts have been eager to see if Wilson can replicate the feat he pulled off in 2011 when he sold Petrohawk Energy to BHP Billiton Plc for $12.1 billion, a 65 percent premium over the share price before the sale was announced. Wilson had predicted in 2012 that a sale of Halcón would take place by 2015. But in 2013, with Halcón's debt load mounting, he changed that time frame, saying any potential sale could come within a few years.

Legend, owner of computer group Lenovo Group Ltd, has been in discussions to buy around 90 percent of the private bank from Precision Capital, an investment vehicle of Qatar royal family members including former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, the person said.People familiar with the industry said they would expect BIL to fetch a price of 1-1.5 billion euros ($1.14 billion - $1.71 billion). Chinese companies have become increasingly interested in European banks, despite the sector's struggles with low profitability and increasing regulatory burden.   In May, China's HNA became the largest direct shareholder in Deutsche Bank, while Fosun holds a 24 pct stake in Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium BCP.[nL8N1I51DM] The deal is likely to be finalised in the coming weeks and Legend is not looking to buy the remaining 10 percent of BIL which is owned by the Luxembourg government, the source said.Another source close to Sheikh Hamad said Precision was in advanced talks to sell its controlling stake to a potential buyer but a final agreement had not yet been reached. The source declined to comment on whether Precision was talking to Legend. The sources could not be identified as the talks are not public.

The sale - the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data - will help strengthen Wanda's case for a mainland listing after its property unit delisted from Hong Kong last year. For Sunac, it would mean ownership of a wide portfolio of tourism developments at a time when it isspending billions on property and technology assets. Wanda said it would offload 91 percent of thirteen cultural tourism projects, which usually include theme parks and leisure complexes, and 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for 63.18 billion yuan. After the sale, Wanda will, however, continue to play a role in operating and managing the projects. Wanda, which also has interests in films and sports, had plans to build at least 20 cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his wolf pack of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy, said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think tank. Beijing has been encouraging development of cultural theme parks as part of a local tourism drive, tapping consumers' growing budget for entertainment. There are over 300 such facilities in China, with most struggling to turn a profit. Wanda's parks are still under construction, except three that have been completed. Two that opened in Nanchang and Hefei last year do not rank in the top 20 by attendance for Asia Pacific, consultancy AECOM's 2016 theme park index shows.The firm, which had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) investment for its cultural and tourism projects, did not give a reason for the sale to Sunac, but local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang as saying the deal would ease the debt burden on Wanda's property unit. Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year, Wang told Caixin. Analysts said the lower debt load could help Wanda's plans to list the unit in Shanghai and to attract a higher valuation. S&P; downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into junk category.

The price tag for the hotels is 33.6 billion yuan. The firms are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month.Sunac will pay for this from its cashpile that stood at over 90 billion yuan at the end of June, Caixin quoted Sun as saying.It had total liabilities of 168.6 billion yuan at the end of 2016, versus 64.5 billion yuan the year before.Shares in Wanda Hotel Development (0169.HK) surged more than 150 percent after news of the deal, though none of the hotels being sold are included under this entity. Wanda said Sunac will be responsible for all the loans for the projects, but the brand name and design will be unchanged. Sunac, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended from trading ahead of what it said would be a very substantial acquisition announcement, declined to comment further. Shares in the developer have more than doubled in value this year, but analysts worry Sunac could have bitten off too much. It has a negative outlook rating from Moody's, which said in April Sunac's leverage had deteriorated significantly due to large amounts of debt it had raised to support acquisitions.

The mills in Hartlepool employ 140 people and have a production capacity of over 250,000 tonnes a year. Tata Steel, Britain's largest steelmaker, has been selling off parts of its UK business since last year, when it announced talks to merge its British and European steel assets with those of Germany's Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE). With this sale, Tata Steel UK will complete its portfolio restructuring to focus on the strip products supply chain linked to Port Talbot, said Bimlendra Jha, CEO of Tata Steel UK. The sale is also an important step towards developing a more sustainable future for the rest of our UK business. In February, Tata signed a 100 million pound deal to sell its specialty steel business to Liberty House, saving 1,700 jobs, mostly in South Yorkshire, northern England. Under Tuesday's deal, Tata retained ownership of a tube mill in Hartlepool that is supplied with steel coils from the European steel assets that it wants to retain and merge with Thyssenkrupp. Tata, whose UK business is centered on the steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales, said it will invest 1 million pounds ($1.29 million) in the Hartlepool tube mill, which employs 270 people. Privately-owned Liberty, which plans to list some of its businesses in 2018, has been snapping up distressed steel assets in Britain and around the world, including in the United States and Australia. This step will inspire investments not only in Hartlepool but also in our upstream plate mill at Dalzell (Scotland), and potentially ... at Whyalla in Australia in due course, to give us a fully-integrated world class capability to supply pipeline projects, Liberty's Executive Chairman Sanjeev Gupta. The Hartlepool pipe mills make heavy-duty steel pipe for the oil and gas sector.Liberty, which operates together with energy and commodities business SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, said it is in talks to secure a support package torecruit more staff for the pipe mills business.Gupta's Liberty House is one of the largest industrial employers in the UK with a workforce of nearly 5,000 people. Following Tuesday's deal, Tata remains the largest UK steelmaker with a workforce of 8,500 people. The UK steel sector is emerging from a crisis that saw some 5,000 jobs, a fifth of the workforce, axed in 2015/16. It is estimated that for every steel job saved, four jobs are retained in related industries.Gupta first hit the headlines last year when he offered to rescue all the distressed UK steel plants owned by Tata, but the Indian group eventually decided against selling its entire UK business in favor of a tie-up with Thyssenkrupp. Editing by David Evans"

In what will be the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data, acquisitive developer Sunac is buying 13 cultural tourism projects and 76 hotels from property giant Wanda. The companies are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month. After the deal, 50 million square meters of saleable gross floor area will be added to Tianjin-based Sunac's land bank, making it one of the largest property developers in the country by land area, after China Evergrande (3333.HK). The average cost per square meter for the 13 cultural projects is 600 yuan, if you give a discount for the undisclosed area of non-saleable land for Sunac, it's still only around 1,000 yuan, said RHB Research analyst Toni Ho in Hong Kong. The deal will give Sunac access to land across tier-one to tier-four cities in one go. Ho said the gross margin of the land involved is at around 20-30 percent, higher than Sunac's average of 13 percent.Sunac's shares surged 13.65 percent, their biggest one-day gain in more than two-and-a-half years, on Tuesday. They resumed trade after being suspended on Monday ahead of news of the pending deal. The Hang Seng Index .HSI gained 1.5 percent. The developer has more than doubled in market value this year to HK$65.7 billion ($8.41 billion). This cooperation will add a large number of prime land reserves and property assets for the company at a reasonable cost, Sunac said in a statement on Tuesday, citing reasons for the deal. FILE PHOTO: A sign of Dalian Wanda Group in China glows during an event announcing strategic partnership between Wanda Group and FIFA in Beijing, China March 21, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoSunac, though, would surpass Evergrande as the most indebted developer in China after the deal, analysts said. RHB's Ho estimated Sunac's gearing ratio will be around 300 percent at the end of year, compared to 208 percent in 2016. Evergrande, which is actively de-leveraging by repaying all its perpetual bonds, is expected to drop below 300 percent. Such acquisition is radical and risky as it will stretch Sunac’s financial position to the extreme given the low return and slow asset turnover of the projects, BOCI analyst Gurney Liu in Beijing said in a report. Liu, who estimated Sunac's net gearing could surge to over 400 percent after the deal, said large-scale development projects and hotels generate lower return than regular property business, and they also lock up significant financial resources for a long investment cycle.After the payment, Sunac's cash on hand would dip to 30 billion yuan, which is less than its borrowings maturing in one year at 38.7 billion yuan as reported in its 2016 annual report, she said. Sunac declined to comment on its leverage position.In the statement, Sunac disclosed Wanda would provide a three-year loan of 29.6 billion yuan, which is almost the same amount as the price for the 13 cultural projects, at a three-year benchmark interest rate. After the deal, Wanda will still be responsible for the operation of the properties, and Sunac will pay an annual management consulting fee for the 13 theme parks of 50 million yuan each to Wanda for a contract term of 20 years.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-m-a-fashion-idUSKBN19V2SX","Fashion M&A;, like a crop top, is hard to pull off","","Jul 11 2017"," (This version of the story was refiled to fix typo in paragraph 13)"," (This version of the story was refiled to fix typo in paragraph 13) By Lauren Hirsch NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions for fashion retailers are like a crop top t-shirt: a risk best braved by a select few and avoided after a certain age. Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N), the teen brand with a 125-year heritage, became the latest to demonstrate that on Monday, ending talks about a potential sale after failing to agree terms with potential suitors. Successful deals in the mercurial world of U.S. fashion are rare, and now look even less likely to succeed as sales dip across the board. Cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design, and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor.As a result, established brands like Abercrombie are having problems finding a savior.Often, as well as spending the money to buy the brand or business, you then have to spend more to do something strategic that will propel growth, and that means paying out twice before getting a return, said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Five of the 20 companies involved in the biggest private equity apparel deals of the last decade have been restructured or gone bankrupt. All struggled under the debt load of a leveraged buyout. The biggest acquisition, Apollo Global Management's roughly $3.1 billion leveraged buyout of Claire's Stores Inc, restructured in 2016.The second-largest acquisition, J. Crew Group Inc, which TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners bought for about $3 billion, is now being restructured. Gymboree Corp filed for bankruptcy last month, seven years after Bain Capital's $1.8 billion purchase. Mounting Pressure Many U.S. fashion bosses are finding they have no option but to consider a sale as pressure mounts from more affordable fast-fashion chains from Europe such as Zara (ITX.MC) and H&M; (HMb.ST), and customers abandon malls in favor of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other online retailers.Outerwear brand Eddie Bauer, for example, is exploring a sale while also seeking relief from its debt load, sources have told Reuters. Teen brand American Apparel explored a sale last year before ultimately filing for bankruptcy.As Abercrombie's experience shows, finding a willing buyer at the right price is difficult.Public company board members are reticent about green-lighting large-scale mergers and acquisitions because it's hard to find a good example of a business that has been rewarded by the equity market for doing so, said Rohit Singh, who specializes in retail at UBS Investment Bank, not speaking specifically about Abercrombie. Struggling retailers are a tough sell to potential acquirers. Merging with another company risks double the trouble – more brands falling flat and more stores bereft of customers.Most fashion retailers are locked into store leases, and as landlords watch their malls empty out, they are increasingly unwilling to give their tenants an easy path out. Perhaps the reason the Abercrombie deal didn’t get done was that they’ve got way too many stores in way too many malls that don’t make any money, and the cost to unwind those pieces and get out of those stores is just too great to compensate for the upside, said Mark Belford, a retail specialist at KPMG Corporate Finance.After failing to strike a deal, Abercrombie now has no choice but to go it alone. On Monday, the New Albany, Ohio-based retailer said it will focus on its growing surf-wear brand Hollister and try to reposition its flagship brand, which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014.Sinking Rocks The most successful acquisitions have been those of younger brands, which have room for growth and have yet to develop expensive supply chains and costly, little-used store bases.Gap Inc's (GPS.N) $150 million purchase of athletic and yoga clothing line Athleta Inc in 2008, for example, gave it a foothold in a growing fashion trend. The acquisition helped save Gap when sales of its jeans slowed as shoppers shifted to leggings. Apparel retailers which bought rivals in the hope of finding growth or eliminating competition have found little payoff. “Oftentimes, the companies themselves aren't growing, so it doesn't solve the underlying challenge, said Josh Chernoff, managing director, retail at consultant Parthenon-EY. If you tie two rocks together, they sink just as fast or faster. The changing winds of fashion derailed Wolverine Worldwide’s $1.2 billion acquisition of boat shoe maker Sperry and other brands in 2012, several of which Wolverine tried to sell this year.Shoppers’ addiction to discounting crushed Men's Wearhouse Inc's $1.8 billion acquisition of rival Jos. A. Bank, the value of which was almost written off. The suit retailer's sales plunged after it abandoned its famous buy-one-get-three-free specials in the wake of the 2014 merger. Ascena Retail Group Inc (ASNA.O), one of the few serial acquirers in U.S. apparel, has been laid low by its roughly $2.1 billion acquisition of Ann Inc, parent of work-wear line Ann Taylor. The 2015 acquisition was meant to give it a full portfolio of womenswear brands and enable it to cut $150 million over three years in costs as it centralized the different lines’ internet infrastructure, distribution and manufacturing. But sales for all its brands have dropped, most recently a combined 8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Ascena's market value is now $400 million, roughly 85 percent lower than before the deal.Fashion is not something you can solve with math, said Belford. Fashion – you either get it or you don’t, and it either sells or it sits on the shelf.

Shares in the group initially jumped more than 3 percent on the news but were down 6 percent by 0900 GMT as analysts processed what the deal would mean for future dividends, with many estimates coming in below expectations.Today's deal enables us to realize a significant amount of the value that we've helped to create (at Penguin Random House) whilst continuing to be part of what is the world's biggest and best trade publisher, said Chief Executive John Fallon. Related CoverageBertelsmann has no plans to buy remaining 25 percent of Random HouseWe'll be using the proceeds to maintain our strong balance sheet, to invest in the ongoing digital transformation of Pearson and return 300 million pounds in excess capital to shareholders.Established as a joint venture between Pearson and Bertelsmann in 2013, Penguin Random House has an enterprise value of $3.55 billion and a list of authors including John Grisham, Arundhati Roy and Paulo Coelho. Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Rabe said the company had achieved its goal of securing a 75 percent majority holding, with Pearson pledging to retain its 25 percent stake for at least 18 months. As part of the deal, Pearson will receive $968 million plus future dividends including a payout of $66 million in April 2018. The two shareholders will take further dividends in future by increasing the book publisher's leverage to two times net debt to core earnings. Analysts said Pearson had extracted a good price without overly diluting its future earnings. However the sale did not change the underlying pressures facing the group's sprawling education business.Employing 35,000, Pearson provides everything from textbooks to school testing, college courses and online degrees around the world. Having grown rapidly for years, it started to lose its way in 2015 when the U.S. economy recovered, encouraging more people to take jobs rather than go into higher education. Since then, students have moved to ditch expensive text books for second-hand copies and digital services, hammering Pearson's income and forcing it to cut costs across the business after it reported five profit warnings in four years. This is the last piece of the family silver to be sold off, after the FT and the Economist, so there's not much scope for Pearson management to pull any more rabbits out of the hat, said Roddy Davidson, media analyst at Shore Capital. Pearson's shares, down 30 percent in the last year, fell a further 6 percent after the company suggested its future dividend would be in the mid-teens, below market expectations of nearer 27 pence. Since this would give just over a 2 percent dividend yield, that is likely to mean the stock loses its appeal to income funds, which had held it because of its formal dividend yield (from 2016), said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker, a long-time critic of the company with a sell rating on the stock.That could put pressure on the stock moving forwards.

While the $879 million flotation by the integrated petrochemical producer was still the largest in Malaysia in five years, its lackluster debut may cast a shadow on the other listings lined up for the year. Lotte Chemical Titan, part of the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, fell 1.8 percent to end at 6.38 ringgit on its first day of trade, giving it a market value of 14.7 billion ringgit ($3.4 billion). The company last week had to cut the size of its offering after its books were undersubscribed and its shares later priced at the bottom of their indicative price range of 6.50-8.00 ringgit per share. The lackluster performance of the stock is from the revision of the final retail price ... creating a negative perception that the stock's growth was fully priced in previously, said Mabel Tan, a Public Investment Bank analyst. Tan said Lotte Chemical Titan's valuation was now attractive as it was cheaper than its peers. It is trading at around 10 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio, compared to its regional peers' average of 12.2, she added. The proceeds raised from our IPO will be used to drive our expansion plan in the ASEAN region to further improve operations and capacity, said Lotte Chemical Titan CEO Lee Dong Woo said. The funds would be used to construct a polypropylene plant in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, develop an integrated petrochemical facility in Indonesia and upgrade the company's existing naphtha cracker, he added. In contrast to Lotte Chemical Titan's weak debut, rival Petronas Chemicals (PCGB.KL), with a market value of about 55 billion ringgit, rose 1.5 percent on Tuesday. Poor market conditions, weak oil prices and a volatile ringgit have been a deterrent for IPOs in recent years, but the Malaysian market has seen a revival of sorts with several offerings planned for the year. Other IPOs reportedly in the pipeline for this year include fast food operator QSR Brands, which is looking to raise about $500 million, and Edra Energy [IPO-EDRA.KL] which is targeting $500 million to $1 billion. Lotte Chemical Titan had originally planned the IPO for last year but postponed it after South Korean authorities began investigating Lotte Group for alleged wrongdoing. Reporting by Liz Lee and A.

On June 21, Toshiba said its preferred bidder was a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors offering $18 billion. Since February, Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its memory chip business, the second largest in the industry after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, to cover losses from its ailing nuclear reactor division.But suitor Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court for an injunction to stop the sale, arguing that a joint-venture it has with Toshiba at a plant in Japan means the chipmaker cannot sell without its consent. In a filing on July 7, Mark Long, the chief financial officer of Western Digital, said the company's most recent offer on June 27, made with private equity firm KKR, is in line with the highest competing bids for (Toshiba's chip unit) that have been reported in the press.The actual dollar figure of Western Digital's offer is redacted from the document. Western Digital declined to comment. A Toshiba spokeswoman declined to comment on deal details, but said Western Digital has not participated in the bid processes since early this year. Western Digital says the bid processes violate their joint venture contracts, and has been making bid offers separately from the processes. Toshiba has asked the court in San Francisco to dismiss Western Digital's attempt to stop the sale, arguing that the U.S. court does not have proper jurisdiction over a business that is based primarily in Japan and that an injunction would cause it irreparable harm. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Aaron Rakers, a managing director with Stifel, said in a note to clients on Sunday that the new filings suggest the two parties could reach a deal before the court hearing. Given that some negotiations between (Western Digital) and Toshiba on proposed acquisition terms started over the past month, we think a resolution could be possible prior to the (July 14) hearing, Rakers wrote.

Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food. The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder. But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (OREP.PA) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016. Unilever (ULVR.L) and Danone (DANO.PA) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent. Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans. Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days, Liberum analysts said. Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts. Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group. Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important.Loeb, dubbed a constructivist for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency. A Nestle company logo is pictured on a bar of Milky Bar chocolate in Manchester, Britain April 25, 2017.Phil NobleAside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business.Maybelline for Maggi Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company.It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up. Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters. Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed. After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent.That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year. For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source.That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (6758.T) and Seven & I Holdings (3382.T).

Moraeus Hanssen, a petroleum engineer and economist, has headed Engie's E&P; business since October 2015 and oversaw the unit's sale to Neptune, part of Engie's strategy to sell 15 billion euro worth of assets until 2018 as it shifts focus to energy grids and services. I'm not going to stay on. We'll have to see what I'm going to do, Moraeus Hanssen told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul. The deal is set to close in late 2017 or early next year. Neptune declined to comment. New owner Neptune, which is backed by private equity funds The Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners, will likely mean a return to more daring exploration investments for the business, Moraeus Hanssen said. The good news for E&P; employees is now they have dedicated owners who want to invest in E&P;, she said. Engie's E&P; business was loss-making in 2015 and 2016, hit hard by writedowns on the back of weak oil prices like its peers in the business. As a result of poor returns in the business and Engie's strategy shift, the group has been investing less in its oil and gas business, with total capital expenditure on the unit dropping below 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) last year. Engie's E&P; business, which mainly consists of assets in the Norwegian, British and Dutch parts of the North Sea, has lately focused on finding fresh resources in areas close to existing fields. We will go deeper and we will look at maybe things that we left behind, like the tighter and deeper zones, Moraeus Hanssen said, highlighting a wider industry trend of dropping riskier frontier exploration in favor of nearfield oil searches since prices started falling three years ago. Growth for the business lies within expanding organically like this but also within acquiring new assets in areas where Engie is present, like Britain's gas-rich southern North Sea basin, Moraeus Hanssen said.

Vocus said Affinity Equity Partners (S) Pte Ltd has matched an informal offer of A$3.50 per share from KKR & Co LP and that it would open its books to both suitors for due diligence. The emergence of further interest in Vocus brightens buyout prospects for a firm which has seen its share price slide in the wake of a May profit warning as it struggles to make the most of acquisitions bought in a three-year $2.4 billion shopping spree. The A$3.50 per share offers are roughly two-thirds below its stock price a year ago. With discussions now officially non-exclusive, and firm interest from a second party established, we are confident a true fair value price discovery process can begin, said David Pace, portfolio manager at Greencape Capital, Vocus' biggest shareholder, in an email. Shares in Vocus, which owns a host of internet infrastructure assets and has Australia's No. 4 internet customer base, rose 3 percent to A$3.53 by late afternoon. A spokesman for KKR was not immediately available for comment, while a spokesman for Affinity which has offices throughout Asia, declined to comment.

The deal comes three months after ClubCorp announced the retirement of is CEO Eric Affeldt and said it had decided not to pursue a strategic transaction, after efforts to explore a sale did not result in any offer for the entire company. However, the Dallas-based company had kept the strategic review committee of its board of directors in place, and had yet to announce Affeldt's successor. It has struggled to turn a profit, as its strategy of boosting its golf club memberships through promotions, refurbishments and acquisitions has proved costly. Apollo said it will pay $17.12 per share in cash for ClubCorp, a 30.7 percent premium over its closing price on Friday, but less than the 12-month high of $17.50 the shares reached in February, on investor expectations that a sale process first reported by Reuters in January would be successful. ClubCorp also declared on Sunday a one-time dividend of 13 cents per share to be paid later this month. It said the sale to Apollo is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017. Founded in 1957, ClubCorp operates more than 200 properties, including golf and country clubs, business clubs and sports clubs across the United States, Mexico and China, serving more than 430,000 members. In May, the company reached a settlement with activist investor FrontFour Capital Group LLC to add two independent directors to its board. FrontFour had called for exploring several options, including a sale. ClubCorp has been a serial acquirer in the golf course industry, buying dozens of courses in the last three years. It has sought to buy locally owned golf courses and refurbish them by adding or improving amenities such as up-scale dining and event rooms. KSL Capital, another private equity firm, acquired ClubCorp for $1.8 billion, including debt, in October 2006 and took it public in 2013.

Elliott revealed in documents published on its website it was unhappy with the recovery to some creditors under an $18.1 billion deal announced by billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire on Friday. The hedge fund believes its acquisition offer would result in a higher payout to debtholders. New York-based Elliott's proposal to acquire Energy Future Holdings Corp calls for a complex conversion of its debt to equity and for an outside equity partner to help finance the deal. Reuters first reported on Elliott exploring a bid for Oncor on Friday. The offer from the hedge fund, which says it has more than $32 billion under management, would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. But even without a competing bid, Buffett's deal faces a difficult road securing the approval of a bankruptcy court judge without Elliott supporting it.We are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott's ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed, the hedge fund said in a letter to the board of Energy Future dated July 5 and released on Monday. Berkshire's offer would help Energy Future exit its costly bankruptcy, which has stretched for over three years as other deals for its crown jewel Oncor fell apart. Energy Future's power generation and retail electricity business were separated from Oncor and emerged from bankruptcy last year. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also disclosed on Monday that it would keep in place a corporate ringfencing structure that would prevent debt from being added to Dallas-based Oncor, or too much cash being paid out as dividends.Regulators in the utility's home state of Texas have demanded such a structure. That was the reason Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) $18.7 billion deal for the utility collapsed earlier this year. Berkshire Hathaway already has reached an agreement on a consensual approval process with regulators, according to a statement from an adviser to Energy Future filed in bankruptcy court. Oncor did not immediately comment on Elliott's letter, while Berkshire was not immediately available for comment. Elliott declined to comment. Elliott's disclosures came after Energy Future filed its new bankruptcy plan of reorganization on Friday. It proposed repaying the unsecured debt that Elliott holds at 18 cents on the dollar.Should Elliott succeed in its offer for Energy Future its unsecured debt would have a recovery of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott holds $2.9 billion of Energy Future's secured and unsecured debt, enough to try to block the reorganization plan with Berkshire, the people said.Elliott built up most of its position in Energy Future's debt after Texas regulators rejected NextEra's offer earlier this year, causing bond prices to crash, the sources said. The hedge fund would break even on its debt investment if the Berkshire bid prevails because gains in some parts of its debt holdings, which would be paid out in full, would offset losses in the unsecured bonds it holds, where it would take a deep haircut, the people said. Elliott, known for its aggressive tactics including a 12-year battle over sovereign debt in Argentina, also may pursue litigation to block the deal, the sources said.Elliott said in the letter it would support a deal with Berkshire or a third party if those bids exceeded the value proposed by the hedge fund. We fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value, the hedge fund said in the letter. Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines.

Rent-A-Center said on Monday it responded to Vintage Capital on July 5.It said in an emailed statement to Reuters that Vintage Capital's proposal significantly undervalues the company and its strategic plan. These initiatives are already delivering substantial progress in key performance metrics, including improved same-store sales and reductions in delinquencies, Rent-A-Center said in the statement. Rent-A-Center, a $609 million company based in Plano, Texas, rents out furniture and electronics and also allows customers the ability to own the products through a lease program.Last month, shareholders ousted three of Rent-A-Center's board directors after a campaign by activist hedge fund Engaged Capital for major changes ended in a full-blown proxy fight. Three of Engaged Capital's nominees replaced the company's directors as a result. Engaged publicly pressed the board to agree to explore the potential sale of the company, among other demands. The hedge fund now holds a 16.9 percent stake in Rent-A-Center, filings show. Fellow activist Marcato Capital Management held just under 1 percent of the stock as of last quarter, Thomson Reuters filings show. Vintage Capital is the majority owner of Buddy's Home Furnishings, a privately run rent-to-own (RTO) peer of Rent-A-Center. Vintage Capital tried to buy fellow RTO company Aaron's Inc (AAN.N) in February 2014 for $2.3 billion, a bid Vintage dropped two months later after the company resisted.

State regulators have become more proactive in recent months toward utility mergers and acquisitions, intervening in deals as they seek to protect local markets amid tough operating conditions for the power industry. Regulatory considerations are also a big part of the $18 billion-plus battle for Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co, which is subject to competing interest from Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management. I'm okay admitting that we were disappointed with the order in April, but the order was specific in what [the regulator] wanted changed and that they were open to us working together to reach a solution, Mark Ruelle, chief executive officer of Westar Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview. The companies are working with all stakeholders including regulators to gain necessary approvals, with the aim of closing the merger in the first half of 2018, according to a joint statement. Balancing Act Under the revised terms, the two firms will approach the tie-up as a merger of equals, with a holding company created, in which Westar Energy shareholders will get one share for each of their current shares, and Great Plains stockholders getting 0.5981 shares for each they own. Previously, Great Plains had proposed buying Westar and making it a subsidiary, using around $8 billion of borrowing: a level of debt with which the Kansas regulator was unhappy. The ultimate structure of merger of equals was the only way to meet the interests of both (shareholders and consumers), Terry Bassham, chief executive officer of Great Plains, told Reuters. The duo have proposed a one-off pool worth upwards of $50 million, which would be distributed to consumers in 2018, while Westar shareholders should expect a 15 percent increase in dividend payouts to match the payout Great Plains stockholders currently receive. The combined company will also buy back around 30 million shares in both 2018 and 2019, Bassham added. Annual cost savings generated by the merger, rising to $140 million to $170 million in 2021, from $35 million to 45 million next year, would help finance these measures, while also allowing the company to achieve the profit level allowed by a regulated utility without increasing customer rates. U.S. power firms are battling the financial impact of greater consumer efficiency on demand, making mergers which help cut costs attractive. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard were financial advisers to Great Plains, with Guggenheim Securities advising Westar. Bracewell and Baker Botts were the respective legal advisers.

Private equity firm Sycamore Partners came closest to acquiring Abercrombie, but could not meet the company's valuation expectations, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Sycamore agreed two weeks ago to acquire U.S. office supplies chain Staples Inc (SPLS.O) for $6.9 billion, the biggest deal in the buyout firm's history.

MetroCast is the latest acquisition in a rapidly consolidating U.S. cable sector that has seen regional providers find new homes in recent months. In April, U.S. cable mogul John Malone's Liberty Interactive Corp said it would acquire Alaska-based cable provider General Communication Inc while private-equity backed RCN announced it would buy Wave in May. Cogeco shares rose about 2 percent to C$81.28. The deal, which includes a $315 million equity investment by Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), will add about 120,000 internet and 76,000 video customers to Atlantic Broadband's U.S. base. The deal allows the company to increase its presence in the growing and lucrative U.S. cable market, Cogeco's Chief Executive Officer Louis Audet said in a statement. In an attempt to find growth outside of Canada, Cogeco first entered the U.S. market in 2012 when it bought Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion. Cogeco said it expects MetroCast to have about $230 million in revenue for 2017 and adjusted earnings of $121 million. Cogeco said Atlantic Broadband should realize tax benefits of about $310 million, and after adjusting for these tax benefits, it is paying about 9 times MetroCast's adjusted annual earnings.MetroCast's network covers areas in New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Atlantic Broadband previously acquired MetroCast's Connecticut business in 2015. Credit Suisse was Cogeco's financial adviser, and Stikeman Elliott and Kirkland & Ellis LLP were its legal advisers.

The proposal to sell privately owned CHX for an undisclosed amount to a consortium led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group (CCEG) has drawn attention because it would be the first time a U.S. exchange has been bought by Chinese investors. There are also U.S. investors in the group. With little or no insight and transparency into government-dominated Chinese markets, the SEC will be unable to monitor the ownership structure of CCEG after approval, leaving CHX open to undue, improper, and possibly state-driven influence, the Republican and Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to the SEC. CHX declined to comment. The SEC, which reviews proposed mergers involving exchanges to ensure they comply with federal regulations and appropriately self-police their brokerage members, said in early June it would take up to another 60 days to make a decision on the sale. CHX is a niche player in the U.S. equities market, executing less than 0.5 percent of U.S. stock transactions.Casin Group, a privately held company that invests in real estate development and financial holdings, said its long-term goal is to list Chinese companies in the United States through CHX, which has locations in Chicago and New Jersey. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, approved the planned sale in December, but the SEC still needs to sign off for it to go ahead.

CME, whose main shareholder is U.S. media group Time Warner (TWX.N), said on Monday it agreed to sell its Croatian and Slovenian operations to United Group's Slovenia Broadband for 230 million euros ($262 million) to pay down debt, boosting shares to an eight-week high.Co-CEO Michael Del Nin said in a telephone interview that the deal would speed up reducing CME's $1 billion debt, cut interest costs and improve profit margins. In the near term we don't have any plans to reduce or expand our geographic footprint, he told Reuters. We need to get to a point where we are comfortable with the balance sheet. This transaction does a lot to get us there. He did not exclude doing smaller deals on ancillary businesses in existing markets, but there was nothing on the horizon. CME had already secured a debt re-pricing deal in March to cut its weighted average borrowing cost by 150 basis points to 7.25 percent. The sale of its Slovenian and Croatian assets will cut that average borrowing cost further, to an expected rate of 4.5 percent, CME said. Most of CME's debt is in term loans guaranteed by Time Warner, which holds a 42.5 percent stake but has a 75 percent share on a fully diluted basis factoring in warrants it holds.Del Nin said the sale deal, expected to be completed by the end of the year, would also help CME's free cash flow generation. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for 18 percent of CME net revenue of $638.0 million in 2016 but only 9 percent of its total operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA), with their smaller scale limiting its margins. Del Nin said CME's OIBDA margin overall was 23.5 percent in 2016, but reached 26 percent when excluding Croatia and Slovenia. That helps understand the potential impact, he said. He also said that while the sales brought forward the possibility of a dividend, CME had a way to go before considering payments and it was unlikely to pay one for this year or next. We have not guided 2018 results but I would be surprised (if) there is a dividend in (that) calendar year, Del Nin said. Editing by Alexander Smith"

The offer for Orient Overseas International Ltd (OOIL) comes as China's government pushes to raise the country's profile in global shipping, which dovetails with its Belt and Road initiative aimed at increasing China's influence over distribution from Asia to Europe. Beijing merged two shippers last year to form COSCO Shipping which, after the latest deal, will rise from fourth to rank only behind Denmark's Maersk Line and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC). This is negative for Maersk and MSC, said Corrine Png, chief executive of Singapore-based transport stock researcher Crucial Perspective. A deal would make the Chinese shipper a tougher competitor to deal with on the major trade lanes. State-backed COSCO Shipping on Sunday offered to buy each OOIL share at a 31.1 percent premium to their Friday close. A suitor's stock often falls after making a bid, but COSCO Shipping's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 6 percent on Monday to their highest price in almost two years. OOIL stock rose as per usual for a target but at 20 percent, it was short of the offer price. Png said some investors may feel OOIL would be selling too soon after the container industry began to recover from a prolonged slowdown, or that the deal may not pass anti-trust regulators. This transaction is a sweeter deal for COSCO than for OOIL's shareholders, she said. OOIL could boost COSCO's recurring profit by 50 percent in the next two to three years.

Its fortunes soared with the Pearl River Delta export boom of the 1990s, but its once world-leading port now languishes in fifth place by throughput, behind the mainland ports of Shanghai and Shenzhen. COSCO said it would to keep OOIL's global headquarters in Hong Kong but analysts said the city's port would still be affected by its takeover. COSCO also has (port) investments in Guangzhou, said Han Ning, China director for Drewry Shipping Consultants, referring to the nearby Chinese city whose port competes with Hong Kong for Pearl River Delta traffic. So if COSCO is looking at what should be its hub for the Pearl River Delta, it will look to strike a balance between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. OOIL commands just under 3 percent of the global container shipping market and has significant exposure to the U.S. market. After the deal, COSCO Shipping can expect a U.S. market share of 18 percent from 11-12 percent currently, said COSCO general manager Zunwu Xu at a news conference on Monday. The acquisition would also strengthen COSCO Shipping's position in the port business, Xu said. The merger would be complementary as OOIL is strong in Transpacific and Intra-Asia trade, and COSCO has strong China domestic trade, said Samson Lo, head of Asia mergers-and-acquisitions at UBS, which is advising COSCO Shipping. The terminals and logistics businesses of OOIL can bring further synergies to COSCO as well. COSCO Shipping is making its offer with Shanghai International Port Group Co Ltd.

The company, which owns television stations in six central and eastern European countries, wants to pay off some of its longstanding debt left over from various missteps before and after the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago. CME, whose main shareholder is Time Warner, expects the sale to close by the end of the year and proceeds will go to repay a 250.8 million euro loan due in 2018, it said in a statement on Monday.That repayment will lower CME's $1 billion debt load and cut its average borrowing cost by 275 basis points to 4.5 percent. Most of the debt is in term loans guaranteed by Time Warner. This transaction underscores the enduring attractiveness of broadcasters in the region. It also moves us significantly closer to our long-held goal of establishing a more appropriate leverage profile for our operations, CME co-Chief Executive Michael Del Nin said in the statement. United Group, which is backed by U.S. investment firm KKR and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), said in a separate statement it would invest further in CME's channels - Nova TV in Croatia and POP TV in Slovenia - once the deal is completed. The group also owns Slovenia's second largest internet provider Telemach.Croatia and Slovenia accounted for 18 percent of CME net revenue of $638.0 million in 2016 but only 9 percent of its total operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA). In 2017, CME has forecast its core profit OIBDA to grow 13-17 percent at constant exchange rates after posting a 21 percent rise last year. With earnings on the rise, it has been pushing to pay down its outstanding debt left over from various missteps before and after the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago.Shares rose as much as 6 percent in Prague in opening trade and were up 4.8 percent at 97.85 crowns at 0821 GMT. Analysts said the sale was positive for shares thanks to the reduction in debt that will lead to more cost savings. CME said the loss of cash generated by the Croatian and Slovenian operations would be offset by estimated savings of $30 million from interest costs annually.

The transaction values Sapa, at 27 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.24 billion) on a debt-free basis. Sapa will enable us to assume global leadership, establish a platform for growth, and provide responsible operations and sustainable solutions for the future low-carbon economy, Hydro Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said. While Hydro itself produces primary aluminum from scratch, Sapa cuts, presses and shapes the metal, making it a key supplier to aircraft makers, automotive firms and the construction industry. The combination will make Hydro the only global company in the aluminum industry that is fully integrated across the value chain and markets, Hydro said. Hydro predicted it would see annual synergies of 200 million crowns, and that the deal would immediately be accretive to earnings and secure strong cash generation. Jointly owned by Orkla and Hydro since 2013, Sapa has 22,400 employees and in 2016 recorded sales of 53 billion crowns.Orkla had previously said it would eventually sell its stake, either directly to Hydro or through an initial public offering. For Norsk Hydro, we consider the transaction to be consistent with the strategy to be an integrated aluminum player, Pareto Securities wrote in a note to clients, adding the transaction valued Sapa 3.6 percent below its own forecast. Completion of the transaction is subject to approval from competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, China, Turkey and the European Union, and is expected in the second half of 2017, Hydro and Orkla said. Danske Bank wrote in a note to clients that the regulatory risk to the deal was low. For Orkla, the sale is a natural consequence of our strategy of becoming a focused branded consumer goods company, Orkla Chief Executive Peter Ruzicka said in a statement. Hydro said it was committed to retain its investment grade rating after the purchase, and that its dividend policy would be unchanged. The transaction will be financed through cash positions and issuance of bonds in Norwegian and international markets, it said. Hydro will maintain its dividend policy of returning 40 percent of net income over the (business) cycle, with NOK 1.25 per share seen as a floor in 2017, it said. Orkla separately said it would pay a special dividend of 5 Norwegian crowns per share when the deal closes. The firm has shed several large businesses in recent years, including breweries and chemicals making, but will continue to build up its remaining operations through acquisitions and investments. We find it positive that Orkla is finally selling, Danske Bank analyst Martin Stenshall wrote in a note to clients, adding the price Hydro would pay was 1.9 percent above his estimated valuation of Sapa. Danske Bank reiterated a hold recommendation on Orkla's shares. Hydro shares traded 1.4 percent higher for the day at 0726 GMT, while Orkla rose 1.8 percent.

Top-tier venture capital firms Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and then a sovereign wealth fund, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Jawbone, lifting its valuation to $3.2 billion in 2014. Ultimately, all that money couldn't save San Francisco-based Jawbone, which began liquidating proceedings in June after its fitness-tracker product failed to take off. It now ranks as the second largest failure among venture-backed companies, based on total funding raised, according to the research firm CB Insights. Jawbone's fall after raising more than $900 million provides a stark example of how the flood of cash pouring into Silicon Valley can have the perverse effect of sustaining companies that have no future, technology executives and financiers say. The irony is Jawbone could have been a suitable acquisition target some years ago, these people say, had it just kept its valuation lower by raising less money from venture capital and sovereign wealth funds.They are basically force-feeding capital into these companies, said Sramana Mitra, a tech entrepreneur and consultant, and founder and CEO of startup accelerator One Million by One Million. I expect there will be a lot more deaths by overfunding. The Jawbone case also underscores the risks that non-traditional startup investors such as sovereign wealth funds face as they ramp up investments in Silicon Valley. The Kuwait Investment Authority led a $165 million investment in Jawbone just last year, when its prospects had already dimmed to the point that most of its original investors were unwilling to put up new funding. These funds, which mange funds of hundreds of billions of dollars, invested $12.7 billion in private tech companies last year, up from $2.2 billion the year before, according to CB Insights. Startup failures are not uncommon, but a billion-dollar company that has raised huge pools of money going belly up remains a rarity. Jawbone ranks behind the solar technology company Solyndra, which became the largest failure among venture-backed companies when it filed for bankruptcy in 2011.Other recent big-dollar failures include used car marketplace Beepi, which closed after raising about $150 million.Some investors say failures like Jawbone won't seriously dent startup funding in the near term. Venture capitalists last year raised $41 billion, a record.Everyone is trying to find a way to play in the tech economy, said Rich Wong, a partner with Accel venture firm. It's inevitable that there will be big-ticket failures. But the Jawbone situation could give pause to investors considering nine-figure investments in unproven firms, say venture capitalists.Since Jawbone’s “downround” last year, a number of other startups - including human resources software firm Zenefits, food subscription company HelloFresh and ride service Ola - have had their valuations slashed because of poor performance and waning investor enthusiasm, contributing to heightened caution in the startup industry over the last several months.The quarterly number of startup financing deals continues to drop from its high in 2015, although with so much cash, investors aren’t shy to write large checks for the select companies they believe will succeed. Ride-services firm Lyft, for instance, raised $600 million in April. Jawbone's liquidation was first reported last week by technology news site The Information and independently confirmed by Reuters. A spokesman for Jawbone declined to comment. Co-founder and chief executive Hosain Rahman did not respond to email from Reuters, and its VC investors declined to comment.Alex Asseily, Jawbone's co-founder who resigned as board chairman and director in January 2015, told Reuters it's saddening to see Jawbone end this way. Loans from Blackrock Jawbone launched in 1999 under the name AliphCom. It cycled through several products, including Bluetooth headsets and speakers, and in 2011 landed on stylish wearable devices to track exercise, sleep and other health data. Along the way, Jawbone burned through more than $500 million in equity and raised more than $400 million in debt, the lion's share from BlackRock, according data provider PitchBook Inc. But the company barely made a dent in the wearables market, with well below five percent market share, and was vastly outperformed by Fitbit, Samsung and others, according to analyst Jitesh Ubrani of International Data Corp.Still, Jawbone raised $147 million in September 2014, bumping its valuation $3.2 billion, according to Pitchbook. In November of the following year, Jawbone laid off 15 percent of its staff amid financial troubles. By December 2015, BlackRock had marked down the company's shares by 69 percent, according to Pitchbook.Then, in 2016, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) invested in Jawbone for the first time, leading a $165 million round that halved Jawbone's valuation to $1.5 billion. The KIA did not respond to requests for comment. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia have in recent years become far more active in investing directly in start-ups, rather than simply investing in venture capital funds.Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the Qatar Investment Authority, for instance, both have big stakes in Uber.Because they have so much more money than traditional venture firms and are less experienced as tech investors, sovereign wealth funds are often called upon to co-invest or lead a risky funding round, say people who invest alongside these foreign funds. Such large fundraising rounds can create this artificially bloated valuation that doesn't compute with the revenue, Mitra said. They can also be a false signal to investors, who often look at how much money a company has raised as a signal of its success, when in fact, it's the opposite, said Rebecca Lynn, a partner at Canvas Ventures. Jawbone tried to sell itself in 2016, but was unable to find a buyer, according to investors with knowledge of the matter. It has been sued by vendors who allege the company owes them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin"

The move is a potential setback for a deal which was cleared last month, more than a decade after the companies first proposed it. Shares of both companies retreated from sharp initial gains after the news. Tabcorp and Tatts took the unusual step of applying to the court-run Australian Competition Tribunal (ACT) after the usual arbiter, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), raised concerns about the deal. On Monday, the ACCC said it has applied to the Federal Court asking it to review the ACT's decision to green-light the deal. We are seeking judicial review because we believe these legal principles are fundamental not only to the Tabcorp decision but to all future merger and nonmerger authorisation assessments, ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The ACCC said it was seeking a review based on the grounds that the ACT misused certain tests which competition regulators use to determine if a deal will hurt competition, and gave inappropriate weightings to data about the effects of the takeover. Tabcorp said in a statement it was studying the application and would provide further information as appropriate. Spokespeople for Tatts and the ACT were not immediately available for comment. The Federal Court will hear the matter in the coming months because the ACCC asked for an expedited hearing, a court spokesman said. When the ACT approved the deal, Tabcorp said it aimed to have the takeover completed in August. After opening sharply higher, shares of Tabcorp and Tatts retreated after the ACCC's statement to both be up about 1.6 percent by mid-session on Monday, while the broader market was up 0.6 percent.Reporting by Byron Kaye and Jamie Freed; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet gave the go-ahead last month for the government to try to sell the airline, after successive governments spent billions of dollars in recent years to keep the airline going. Air India - founded in the 1930s and known to generations of Indians for its Maharajah mascot - is saddled with a debt burden of $8.5 billion and a bloated cost structure. The government has injected $3.6 billion since 2012 to bail out the airline. Once the nation's largest carrier, its market share in the booming domestic market has slumped to 13 percent as private carriers such as InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo and Jet Airways (JET.NS) have grown. Previous attempts to offload the airline have been unsuccessful. If Modi can pull this off, it will buttress his credentials as a reformer brave enough to wade into some of the country's most intractable problems. His office has set a deadline of early next year to get the sale process underway, the officials said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans. The timeline is ambitious and the process fraught, with opinion divided on the best way forward: should the government retain a stake or exit completely, and should it risk being left with the unprofitable pieces while buyers pick off the better businesses, officials said. Already, a labour union that represents 2,500 of the airline's 40,000 employees has opposed the idea of a sale even though it is ideologically aligned to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Related CoverageFactbox: Air India subsidiariesOfficials who have to make it happen are grappling with the sheer scale of the exercise. Air India has six subsidiaries – three of which are loss-making – with assets worth about $4.6 billion. It has an estimated $1.24 billion worth of real estate, including two hotels, where ownership is split among various government entities. No one has properly valued the company's various businesses and assets before, two officials with direct knowledge of the process said. Earlier this month, about $30 million worth of art, including paintings by artist M. F. Husain, went missing from its Mumbai offices, chairman Ashwani Lohani said. The exercise is complex and there is no easy way out, said Jitendra Bhargava, operational head of Air India in 1997-2010. At this juncture, selling even part of Air India is far from certain. Lohani declined to comment on the sale process. The prime minister's office and the civil aviation ministry also declined to comment. An Air India aircraft takes off from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad, India, July 7, 2017.Amit DaveBack to Tata? A committee of five senior federal ministers, led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to meet this month and begin ironing out the finer details of the plan. Besides deciding about the size of the stake sale, the panel will set the bidding norms. It will also take a call on the carrier's debt, demerger and divestment of its three profit-making subsidiaries. Modi's office has said the government has no business being in hospitality and travel, suggesting the prime minister wants to sell as much of Air India as possible, the officials said. Analysts say the government may prefer to keep the airline in Indian hands. At least two potential Indian suitors – the Tata Sons conglomerate and IndiGo - have shown early interest. Slideshow (2 Images)In recent weeks, officials in Modi's office and from the civil aviation ministry met Ratan Tata, the patriarch of the $100 billion-a-year Tata Sons, to gauge the company’s interest in a deal, a close aide to Modi said. Tata would be an attractive buyer for the government. The company founded and operated Air India before it was nationalised in 1953. Seems like Tata will come forward and make the best offer, the aide said, adding the government would be keen to see that jobs are not lost. Tata, however, already has two other airline joint ventures in India, and it's not clear what parts of Air India it would be interested in. A Tata spokeswoman declined to comment. IndiGo said on Thursday it was interested in the international operations and in Air India Express, a low-cost carrier. Modi's office has told officials to work out exactly how much each of Air India's subsidiaries are worth to make it easier to break up the carrier if needed, two of the officials said. The government is expected to appoint outside consultants to help with the exercise. Anshuman Deb, aviation analyst at ICICI Securities, said splitting the airline will maximize value for the government. Let us be realistic.

The firm's biggest domestic rival, Suez (SEVI.PA), announced the $3.4 billion purchase of GE Water from General Electric (GE.N) in March. Asked whether Veolia could spend as much on an acquisition, its boss Antoine Frerot told Reuters the size of the group's balance sheet would allow it.Frerot, who earlier this year said he would favor organic growth for the business, laid out two conditions for any future large acquisition. It would need to create new large-size activities for the company and over a long period of at least 10 to 15 years, Frerot said in an interview at a business conference in the southeastern city of Aix-en-Provence.If we found this, then obviously we'd have the means to do it, he said, declining to elaborate on possible targets. Veolia, which also cleans up nuclear facilities and treats low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste, could also benefit from a 50-billion-euro ($57 billion) upgrade of French nuclear sites operated by energy provider EDF (EDF.PA), Frerot said.EDF's upgrade is scheduled for 2014-2025 and aims to extend the life expectancy of its nuclear installations by more than 40 years.

Telecom (TEC2.BA) and Cablevision recently said they reached a merger agreement enabling them to offer so-called quadruple play services combining TV, Internet and fixed and mobile phone lines into a single package and realizing a key goal of President Mauricio Macri's telecom sector reforms. But the new company would use a bigger portion of available airwaves than any single telecoms provider is allowed, exceeding the maximum allowed frequency limit of 140 megahertz, said the source, asking not to be identified. Enacom and the National Commission for the Defense of Competition, or CNDC, both have to approve the merger, which would create a company with a market cap of about $11 billion, according to brokerage Itau BBA. Definitely, at one glance, there is an excess of the 140 megahertz limit that the combined company would have. This is the merger's first problem, the source said. Radio airwaves have become an increasingly valuable commodity for wireless telecoms operators which need them to satisfy demand for video and music streaming among other data-heavy services. Argentina's Communications Ministry plans to increase the maximum allowed megahertz limit to between 160 and 180, but that would still be too low for the estimated 220 megahertz that the combined company would have, the source said. The excess frequency would have to be returned to the state, the source added. That step would be part of a broader regulatory review expected to take at least six months, the source said. The merger of the two separate companies in which Mexican billionaire David Martinez holds stakes will require shareholder as well as regulatory approval. Telecom Argentina is to issue 1.184 billion shares,leaving Cablevision shareholders with 55 percent of the combinedcompany, the companies said in announcing the merger plan.Shortly after taking office in December 2015, Macri signed a decree to allow phone companies to offer pay television services, an area that had long been dominated by Cablevision, an internet, cable TV and data transmission company that was previously part of Grupo Clarin (CLA.BA).

The transaction, due to close in the third quarter, will be funded with cash and will not affect MetLife's $3 billion share buyback program, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. By adding Logan Circle's $33.7 billion of assets under management, MetLife is boosting its investment management business at a time when U.S. insurers are placing increased emphasis on such revenue streams after contending with years of low interest rates and regulatory challenges. The upcoming spinoff of its retail life insurance business, Brighthouse Financial Inc, has been part of that strategy. The Logan Circle deal would allow MetLife to earn more recurring cash flow and revenue from activities which do not tie up as much of the insurer’s capital, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart said in an interview. Goulart noted its strategy foresaw MetLife as an institutional, fixed-income asset manager, with Logan Circle jump-starting the public fixed-income aspect of this. He declined to provide any forecasts on how Logan Circle would affect MetLife's revenue. While he expected most future growth in this part of the business to come organically, MetLife was open to potential further acquisitions if the right asset came along, he added. Reuters reported in April that Fortress, which is being acquired by Japan's SoftBank Group (9984.T) for $3.3 billion, was seeking to divest Logan Circle. Founded by Chief Executive Jude Driscoll in 2007 as a joint venture between management and Guggenheim Partners LLC, Logan Circle was bought by Fortress in 2010 for an initial $21 million. Asset manager Fortress' investments span real estate, hedge funds and private equity. The all-cash sale to SoftBank, expected to close in the second half of 2017, is the Japanese company's first major investment in an asset manager after previously focusing on telecoms and technology firms.

If Elliott, the hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, proceeds with such a bid, it would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. Elliott would seek to convert its debt in the company to equity, as well as raise new equity financing for its bid, the sources said. As with Buffett's deal, a bankruptcy judge would have to approve Elliott's alternative plan. Elliott's stance illustrates the complexities of acquiring companies whose debt is trading at distressed levels. SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, another famed dealmaker, saw the $14 billion merger between the Japanese company's satellite startup OneWeb and debt-laden peer Intelsat SA collapse last month after many of the latter's creditors refused to back the deal.The hedge fund believes it can put together a higher offer than the deal announced on Friday by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which has a total value of $18.1 billion including debt, the people said. In May, Elliott held about $2.9 billion of Oncor parent Energy Future Holdings' roughly $10 billion debt load, with its investment concentrated in a layer of unsecured payment-in-kind notes trading at deeply distressed levels. The hedge fund amassed its position in Energy Future's debt from October to May, according to court papers.Elliott is considering pursuing an alternate deal for Energy Future because it thinks Berkshire's offer undervalues the Oncor business, seen as the bankrupt company's crown jewel asset, the people said. Elliott may also seek to use its rights as a creditor to Energy Future to block the sale of the company to Berkshire in bankruptcy court, according to the sources.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Elliott declined to comment, while Oncor and Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire's pursuit of Energy Future comes after two other suitors, most recently NextEra Energy, failed to win approval from regulators. The unsecured payment-in-kind notes Elliott holds fell in value by close to 30 percent in secondary trading on Friday on news of the Berkshire deal, to about 29.5 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns over these notes' recovery prospects. When NextEra clinched a deal last year to buy Energy Future and Oncor in a deal worth $18.4 billion, including debt, Berkshire also submitted a bid at the time, the sources said. Berkshire's bid then valued Energy Future at more than its deal on Friday does, the sources added.Elliott has developed a reputation on Wall Street as an aggressive debt investor, having engaged in a fierce battle with Argentina over its sovereign debt that spanned more than a decade.Elliott filed a lawsuit in May against Energy Future asking for it to consider debt reorganization alternatives, including a plan that would involve converting Elliott's significant debt holdings in the company to equity, eventually putting Oncor under the hedge fund's control.

Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets. A trial is scheduled for October. Waymo and ride-hailing service Lyft, which is a competitor to Uber, announced a partnership to get self-driving vehicles on the roads earlier this year.As part of its litigation defense, Uber requested documents and other information about the deal from both Waymo and Lyft. In a ruling on Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ordered Waymo to disclose due diligence documents over the deal, saying Uber could use them to assess Waymo's argument that it suffered monetary damages from Uber's actions. Corley said Lyft did not have to produce any documents. A Waymo spokesman did not have immediate comment on the ruling. Also on Friday, Waymo said it would dismiss three out of four patent claims it had filed against Uber, while maintaining one patent claim over a circuit for its laser technology.

Under terms of a bid originally submitted on Monday, Brookfield would buy out the stake that Light SA (LIGT3.SA) has in Renova at an equivalent of 9 reais per unit. The same offer was extended to stakeholder Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA (CMIG4.SA) and founding partner RR Participações SA, the people said. Canada's Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy acquisitions in Brazil over the past year, would pay Renova's controlling bloc about 810 million reais ($247 million) for their stakes and pump about 800 million reais worth of fresh capital into the company, the same person said. Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based Cemig and Light declined to comment, while calls to a Brookfield spokesman in São Paulo were not immediately answered. Representatives of RR could not be immediately reached for comment. Renova units (RNEW11.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, reversed losses on the news, adding up to 2.7 percent to 7.88 reais late Friday afternoon. The stock has gained almost 30 percent since January 2 when Reuters first reported that the company could be taken over.Newfound interest in Renova underscores a view among foreign investors that the outlook for Brazil's renewable power industry remains resilient even as consumption suffers with the country's worst recession ever. For Cemig, exiting Renova allows Brazil's No. 3 power utility to accelerate efforts to refinance almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. Final Accord Board members at the utility known as Cemig, which has a 44 percent voting stake in Renova, will formalize their support to the improved Brookfield bid on Wednesday, one of the people said. An accord between Cemig, Light, RR and Brookfield could be signed as early as July 14, the same person added. Buying out the entire controlling bloc would give Brookfield an 82.2 percent voting stake in Renova. One of the people said Brookfield's sweetened bid should trump a proposal by Oaktree Capital Management LP to refinance debt and inject fresh capital into Renova, which Reuters reported on July 5. At 9 reais, Brookfield would be paying a 28 percent premium per unit of Renova (RNEW11.SA), based on their June 30 close - the last business day before Reuters reported the bid. Each Renova unit is comprised of one common and two preferred shares. Brookfield's bid would also give equal treatment to minority shareholders, the people said. The so-called tag along will be based on the proportion of common and preferred shares contained in Renova's units, they added. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc (SUNEQ.PK) collapsed weeks before the latter filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.

Rather than publicly commenting on premature conclusions of Haldex about the status of specific discussions with competition authorities, Knorr-Bremse will continue its cooperation with the authorities to assist them in reaching an informed decision on the merits of this transaction, the firm said on Friday. Haldex said earlier on Friday that feedback from U.S. authorities reinforced its view, as the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) concerns affected six of its eight product areas and would hit all but one manufacturing facility. The divestments will consequently be too extensive to procure competitive solutions that the authority would approve, saying the only reason for Knorr-Bremse to continue pursuing a deal was to dismantle and eliminate a competitor.

If the all-cash purchase wins approval from federal and state regulators and a bankruptcy judge, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit will assume control of one of the largest U.S. electricity transmission companies. Buffett views infrastructure bets as a good long-term investment, said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, which invests $300 million of the $1.4 billion it oversees in Berkshire. With the relatively limited opportunities available to a company of Berkshire's size, investments such as Oncor that are likely to yield 8 to 10 percent annually are acceptable, Check added. The acquisition also highlights the growing prominence of Greg Abel, 55, Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chief executive. Investors consider him a top candidate to succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company's helm. Abel and other Berkshire Hathaway Energy executives were not available on Friday for interviews. Buffett's office did not respond to separate interview requests. 'Recession Resistant' Dallas-based Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines. It is 80 percent owned by Energy Future Holdings Corp, the company Berkshire has agreed to buy out of bankruptcy. Oncor posted $431 million of profit in 2016, and similar sums in the prior three years. Buffett values such consistency, telling Berkshire shareholders in February that utilities generate recession-resistant earnings because they offer an essential service that generates remarkably steady demand. Meanwhile, Abel said in a statement the companies share a common goal of providing exceptional customer service and a commitment to invest in critical infrastructure. Abel has also been deepening his commitment to renewable energy, including wind, generating tax credits that bolster Berkshire's balance sheet. His unit also owns HomeServices of America, a big residential real estate brokerage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy typically generates nearly 10 percent of its parent's profit, contributing $2.29 billion to an overall $24.07 billion in 2016. Buffett has always had a lot of confidence in Greg Abel, and wouldn't mind putting a nearly unlimited number of businesses under his watch, Check said. Texas Regulator The Oncor purchase requires approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), which in 2016 and 2017 scuttled takeover bids by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc and NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N). Regulators had asked for Oncor to be ringfenced so it would not assume excess debt from any acquirer, and also not pay out too much cash as dividends. Unlike NextEra, Berkshire might be more willing to leave the ringfence in place and allow restriction on dividends, making the approval process a little less cumbersome, Cowen & Co analyst Amer Tiwana wrote in a research report. The PUCT is required by law to rule on Berkshire's bid within six months of receiving an application. A spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire's prospects. But Buffett wrote last year that regulators like Berkshire Hathaway Energy because it operates safely and efficiently and has unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense, without the need to pay dividends to its parent.Berkshire expects to complete the Oncor purchase in the fourth quarter. It said the transaction implies an equity value of about $11.25 billion for Oncor. Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm representing Energy Future, said the transaction's enterprise value was about $18.1 billion. Energy Future was created from the $45 billion leveraged buyout in 2007 of the former TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm. The buyout was a bet that natural gas prices would rise, allowing for higher electricity prices. Natural gas prices plunged instead, and Energy Future went bankrupt in 2014. Undoing an 'Unforced Error' Buffett had invested with Energy Future a decade ago, buying $2 billion of high-yield bonds. But he threw in the towel six years later, with an $873 million pre-tax loss. He has called that investment a major unforced error. Buffett entered the energy sector in 2000 when he led a group that bought Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, later renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy. He has since expanded in the central and western United States, such as with the Oregon-based PacifiCorp and Nevada-based NV Energy utilities. Berkshire has also forayed outside the United States, now owning the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, Canada and Northern Powergrid in Newcastle upon Tyne in England. Such bets have enabled Buffett to diversify Berkshire away from its traditional focus on insurance and stock-picking. Berkshire now owns more than 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Lubrizol chemicals and Dairy Queen ice cream. Assuming the Oncor transaction closes, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard would become executive chairman and be replaced by general counsel Allen Nye, under a previously announced plan.

The previously undisclosed details on the negotiations show how Amazon used its deep pockets and brand as leverage to convince Whole Foods to accept a sale process that would not result in a bidding war. Whole Food shares traded above Amazon's $42-per-share deal price for the first few days after the agreement was announced on June 16, on investor expectations of a higher bid. They have since traded slightly below that price, as such hopes dampened. The regulatory filing shows that Whole Foods agreed to forgo an auction process after it received expressions of interest from two other companies and four private equity firms. None of these parties are identified by name. The filing refers to a 'company X,' which proposed a merger of equals that valued Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 per share. U.S. supermarket chain owner Albertsons LLC is company X, a source familiar with the matter said. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods agreed not to pursue this, or solicit any other bids, in part because Amazon was very sensitive with respect to confidentiality and did not want to compete in a broader sale process, the filing said.Whole Foods said in the filing it sought $45 per share from Amazon but settled for $42 per share, which the ecommerce giant called its best and final offer. Amazon had offered $41 in May, according to the filing. Amazon had also told Whole Foods it was considering other opportunities in case its final offer was turned down. The filing added that Amazon reserved the right to terminate the talks if there was any leak or rumor of its interest in Whole Foods.The other company that expressed interest in Whole Foods, referred to in the filing as 'company Y,' had an interest in exploring a commercial relationship, such as a supply arrangement, and did not discuss any merger or acquisition, according to the filing. Whole Foods' management, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC to explore a sale of the company, decided not to solicit proposals from the four private equity firms as the price proposed by Amazon likely exceeded the amount a private equity buyer could be expected to pay, according to the filing.

The stake sale will test the interest of some of the largest consumer food companies, which are looking to revitalize their sales as consumers turn to novelty and healthier alternatives.A deal could also give thirteen-year old Kind, which has developed a brand known for its use of ingredients people can see and pronounce, its first corporate partner to expand both in the United States and abroad. New York-based Kind, which has $727 million in annual sales according to Euromonitor, is working with investment banks BDT Capital Partners and Centerview Partners Holdings LLC on the stake sale, the sources said. BDT is also a minority investor in Kind. The process could attract large food companies such as Kellogg Co (K.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Mars Inc, the sources said. Kind is not offering the right to buy out the entire company down the line as part of the deal, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the process is confidential.Kind is solely focused on becoming the foremost health and wellness leader to provide our consumers with delicious and healthy products so they can do the kind thing every day, a Kind spokesman said, declining to comment specifically on the stake sale process. BDT declined to comment and Centerview could not be immediately reached for comment. Kind, founded in 2004 by Daniel Lubetzky, the Mexican-American son of a Holocaust survivor, sells nut bars, breakfast bars, clusters and fruit bites. It was one of the first popular food snacks to eschew artificial flavors andpreservatives, a trend that larger food companies are now embracing as they seek to woo back customers. In the United States, the world's biggest packaged food market, upstart brands such as Kind could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time compared with 5.0 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. In search of growth, food companies have turned to acquisitions, such as General Mills' $820 million deal for organic food maker Annie’s Inc in 2014. Still, minority investments in established brands such as Kind have been less frequent.Private equity firm VMG group bought a stake in Kind in 2008. It later sold back its share to Lubetzky in 2014 in a stake sale that valued the company at $728.5 million. Reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York"

Those people say Toshiba's leadership is sticking to Plan A: selling the world's second-largest memory chip maker to a Japanese government-backed group that also includes Bain Capital. But the clock is ticking for Toshiba, which was still recovering from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse in December.Unless it closes a deal by March, a gaping balance-sheet hole will prompt automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo's stock market - further battering its shareholders. As questions emerge around the role of South Korean rival SK Hynix in the preferred bidder group, some Toshiba executives and officials at the company's main creditor banks say they want top management to look at other options. Toshiba hastily picked the consortium ahead of its [June 28] annual shareholders meeting, but more and more flaws are emerging as time passes, said a senior official at one of Toshiba's banks. SK Hynix, which was initially included just to help fund the deal, is now looking to own equity in Toshiba's chips unit, according to sources, raising antitrust and national concerns in Japan. SK Hynix has not commented. Addressing concerns that its chip technology could be handed to a foreign rival, Toshiba said previously that SK Hynix would have no equity or management influence. Scrapping that deal would leave one obvious option: rival suitor Western Digital, which bid for the chip business with private equity firm KKR. But Western Digital, already a Toshiba joint venture partner, is in a legal dispute with the Japanese firm, and sources describe a deep distrust. But Western Digital could have the support of government-backed Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) and Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) - both currently part of the preferred buyer consortium - the sources said. They are said to be wary of SK Hynix, and of Toshiba agreeing a sale to the group while Western Digital has sought an injunction to stop it. If asked, we are ready to team up with Western Digital and KKR, and we actually prefer that, said a senior official at one of the government investors. Both the DBJ and INCJ declined to comment.A Toshiba spokesman said the firm is negotiating with the preferred buyer consortium to sign a definitive agreement as soon as possible. The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind a traffic light at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan March 29, 2017.Issei KatoSelling other assets seems a less likely avenue, as Toshiba has few of sufficient value, and a piecemeal process could take too long.It sold its medical equipment business to Canon Inc for $6 billion last year. There are plans to list Toshiba's smart meter business Landis+Gyr, but that will not plug the gap. Toshiba turned down offers from buyout group CVC and industrial conglomerate Hitachi to buy the business for almost $2 billion earlier this year, sources have said. Toshiba cannot raise cash by issuing shares because of restrictions imposed by the bourse after the 2015 scandal. Deal or No Deal Toshiba has been scrambling for cash for months - since it shocked investors late last year with news of the cost overruns and delays at Westinghouse, which forced a hefty writedown and losses. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March in one of the nuclear industry's most costly collapses to date, leaving Toshiba to cover $6 billion of liabilities it guaranteed. Even so, investors and some creditors say they fear Toshiba may simply refuse to consider what appears to be the most obvious option. Some within Toshiba say they'd rather die than be (acquired by) Western Digital, said a banking official who has discussed the deal with senior Toshiba executives. Western Digital is a recent partner for Toshiba - it bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner for 17 years, in May last year. A leap from joint venture partner to buyer would have to overcome significant distrust. Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent a sale of Toshiba's chips arm without its consent. We worked with SanDisk over more than 10 years, but it's been just one year that we've worked with Western Digital executives, and we've had no good experience from it, a senior Toshiba executive said. Two people familiar with the matter said Toshiba believes that even if the court grants the injunction, it can proceed with a chip sale agreement - so long as it holds off completion. U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, previously considered a major candidate with a $20 billion offer for the Toshiba chips arm, backed off due to legal risks involving Western Digital.

Faced with opposition from Akzo's boards, PPG dropped its attempt to buy the maker of Dulux paints on June 1. Under Dutch securities law PPG cannot approach the company again for at least six months. PPG's final proposed offer in cash and shares was worth more than 95 euros per Akzo share. The company's stock was trading up 0.2 percent on Friday at 77.58 per share. In a preliminary ruling in May Amsterdam's Enterprise Chamber rejected Elliott's bid to compel Akzo to convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to vote on dismissing Antony Burgmans, saying it was an attempt to wrest control of the company's strategic direction from the board.. That case is continuing. But Elliott said on Friday it had started a new action at a different venue, the Interim Relief Court, which is part of Amsterdam's District Court. The Enterprise Chamber case is expected to take months, with the next hearing scheduled for September 20, while the District Court case should be heard within several weeks. A date has not yet been set. Elliott, which is now Akzo's largest shareholder with a 9.5 percent stake, said it had lost all confidence in Burgmans and believed it must pursue the case to defend shareholder rights under Dutch corporate governance law. In response, Akzo Nobel's director of public and media relations Diana Abrahams said the company has been in close contact with its shareholders since the ruling in May, when the judges also told it to repair relations with its disgruntled shareholders. We have had more than 130 contacts with shareholders in June, seeking feedback, Abrahams said, adding that the company would put forward a plan to appease shareholders at the company's second-quarter results on July 25. Akzo is also seeking to sell its chemicals division, representing a third of profits, in order to fund an extraordinary dividend and share buyback to placate investors. Under Dutch law shareholders are in theory granted the right to request an extraordinary meeting of shareholders but the Enterprise Chamber ruling restricted the circumstances for exercising that right. Elliott said on Friday that now that PPG's bid was off the table it is merely attempting to censure the company's management for poor performance, rather than seeking to change its strategic direction. Elliott finds Chairman Burgmans’ views on shareholder democracy to be archaic and wholly unacceptable in today’s capital markets, it said in a statement.A board which holds itself accountable to no one is not an appropriate governance paradigm.

(Reuters) - People injured by Takata Corp's defective air bags were given an official role in the bankruptcy of its U.S. unit on Thursday, allowing them to challenge restructuring plans that plaintiffs' lawyers have criticized as protective of automakers. A seven-member official committee will represent economic loss and personal injury or tort claimants, David Buchbinder, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, told a meeting of creditors of Takata's U.S. business. Official committees receive funds from a debtor to hire professionals who can carry out investigations and test financial assumptions. William Weintraub, a lawyer with Goodwin Procter who is not involved in the Takata case, said he expected the committee to be active and to make sure that the claims of the car manufacturers are not treated preferentially and that tort victims are fairly compensated.A second five-member committee of suppliers and vendors was also appointed, according to Buchbinder. Takata filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United States last month, facing billions of dollars in liabilities from recalls and lawsuits stemming from its air bags.The inflator compound used in the bags becomes volatile with age, causing the devices to inflate with too much force. The air bags have been linked to 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and hundreds of injuries.One person appointed to the personal injury committee, Adrian Antonio Pielago, allegedly suffered a major neck laceration and nerve damage last year in an accident involving a Takata air bag, according to court records. Takata is finalizing a $1.6 billion sale of most of its business to Michigan-based Key Safety Systems, owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS). The deal is meant to save 14,000 jobs, provide a stable supply of replacement air bags and finance a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. government.Personal injury lawyers said at a bankruptcy hearing last month that Takata was deferring too much to automakers, which claim they are owed billions of dollars in recall costs. Lawyers for Takata's U.S. business said the automakers provided financing to Takata and received protections in return. The company has set aside $125 million for injury claims, but lawyers for injured drivers said it may not be enough because millions of air bags have yet to be recalled. The lawyers say more money could come from Takata's insurance, as well as from its sale to Key Safety. "

The decision means Airbus (AIR.PA) will have to try to resell or reallocate the 283-seat jets at a time when demand for big planes is softening, and could cost Airbus $60-80 million to rip out and replace interiors designed to fit the airline's plush brand. Smart players are not going to rush in, because other cancellations or deferrals may come, said veteran aircraft financier Bertrand Grabowski, former board member at DVB Bank. The cancellation follows concerns about delays and quality problems on cabin equipment for the A350, but also comes at a time when Qatar is entering the second month of a crisis caused by a ban on Qatar's use of the airspace of four Arab nations. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said earlier any delays were the planemaker's responsibility. We are asking Airbus to deliver it faster, he told a Dublin news conference. The delay is from Airbus. An Airbus spokesman said the cancellations were related to known supply chain issues. Asked what would happen to the undelivered A350-900 jets, he said: They will be reallocated. Qatar Airways has a reputation for being demanding whenreviewing aircraft for quality defects before delivery.However, some analysts have said the Gulf political crisis may give the airline a further incentive to slow deliveries, compounding the impact of relatively weak oil prices. All the Gulf carriers realize they have ordered too many wide-bodied aircraft and don't have room for them, especially now, said an aircraft finance industry official.

Fightback vs Boeing The Qatar setback extends a torrid week for Airbus as it tries to bounce back against a resurgent Boeing (BA.N) and shake off an internal row over a shake-up in its sales organization. The surprise decision to have the sales team report to Chief Executive Tom Enders and by-pass airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, first reported by Reuters, raised hackles internally and prompted concerns about a power battle. Enders on Wednesday defended the decision, saying it was about freeing his no.2 to focus on core operations. The Airbus sales force has been urged not to dwell on the reorganization and to push back aggressively against Boeing which won the Paris Airshow for the first time in five years. Sales chief John Leahy, who plans to retire this year, has also warned staff that Airbus faces a stronger and much more aggressive competitor, people familiar with the matter said. Airbus took 248 orders between January and June, or 203 after cancellations. As of June 27, Boeing had notched up 407 orders this year, or 361 after cancellations. On Wednesday, China signed a deal to buy 140 Airbus jets. Leahy, who will report to Enders for a few months before handing to his designated successor Kiran Rao, also delivered an internal tribute to Bregier, saying he helped us win. Bregier, whose reign as head of the planemaking business has coincided with the sale of 5,800 jets, has urged staff to remain focused on customers and pledged to do the same in his new role.

The state-owned carrier notified American Airlines last month that it was interested in buying up to 10 percent of its shares but would not exceed 4.75 percent without the approval of American's board. We will be able to start buying shares in the open market soon, depending of course on what is the share value, al Baker told reporters in Dublin, where he was launching a new Qatar Airways route.The share purchases will start as soon as Qatar receives regulatory approval, he said.However, American said in a regulatory filing dated June 22 that company rules prohibit anyone from acquiring 4.75 percent or more of the company's shares in issue without prior board approval. Shares in American were up 0.5 percent at $51.53 at 1342 GMT on Thursday, valuing the company at over $25 billion. The move by Qatar Airways would expand its investments to North America at a time when Qatar is embroiled in the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights row with three other Gulf states. Qatar has no intention of going above 10 percent, al Baker said.Al-Baker said American's CEO Doug Parker told him at an airline conference in Mexico last month that he was against Qatar's planned investment and that he would not recommend that the board approve the purchase of a stake of over 4.75 percent. He categorically told us that he was not interested, that he would not suggest to his board to allow us. However, I told him we can still take 4.75 percent and we will do that, al Baker said.Air travelers stand at an American Airlines check-in gate at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S., March 14, 2017.Shannon StapletonMaybe once we have taken that 4.75 and they see the value that Qatar Airways brings to the table for them that they will reconsider, he said. Anti-Gulf Stance He said he had no ambition to influence American's management or soften what he said was its anti-Gulf stance. Along with United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), American has pressed the U.S. government to curb U.S. flights by Qatar Airways and rival Gulf carriers Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways. The U.S. carriers charge that their Gulf rivals have received billions of dollars in unfair state subsidies, allegations the Gulf carriers deny. A stake in American Airlines would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio. The Middle East's second biggest airline also has a 20 percent stake in International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, and a 10 percent stake in Chile's LATAM Airlines LAN.SN. Qatar Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the oneworld airline alliance. British Airways and Qatar Airways have a revenue-sharing partnership between their respective hubs in Doha and London, and Qatar Airways plans to launch flights to LATAM's base in Santiago, Chile. Al-Baker made repeated digs at American, saying it wanted to keep out the Gulf carriers from the U.S. market so it could swindle their customers. My dear friend Doug Parker, a big supporter of oneworld ... is now frightened of a oneworld carrier wanting to take a stake, he said. Editing by Greg Mahlich"

BeiGene's shares rose as much as 31.4 percent to an all-time high of $68.67 in afternoon trading on Thursday. Celgene's shares were marginally down. The deal announced on Wednesday will complement Celgene's partnership with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) to develop durvalumab as a treatment for hematological malignancies and expand the drug developer's presence in China's untapped cancer market. BeiGene's advanced tumor cancer therapy, BGB-A317, is a type of antibody that belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. The treatment has been tested in more than 500 patients, with initial data suggesting that it is well-tolerated and exhibits anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumor types, the companies said. We believe Celgene's ability to combine approved therapies in-house with either durvalumab or BGB-A317 provides the company flexibility during development and commercialization, William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said in a client note. BeiGene will get $263 million in upfront license fees and $150 million in equity investment. The company will also be eligible to receive up to $980 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. This is a shockingly good deal for BeiGene as it monetizes a market that is virtually impenetrable to all but the largest pharma players in the cancer space, Baird analyst Brian Skorney said. Last month, Hutchison China MediTech (HCM.L), the Shanghai-based drugmaker listed in London and commonly known as Chi-Med, filed a marketing application for its cancer drug fruquintinib with the China Food and Drug Administration. Chi-Med is developing the treatment for advanced colorectal cancer in collaboration with U.S. drug developer Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N). BeiGene will acquire Celgene's operations in China and also license and assume commercial responsibility for Celgene's approved therapies - Abraxane, Revlimid and Vidaza - in the region. Celgene will acquire 32.7 million of BeiGene's ordinary shares at $4.58, or $59.55 per BeiGene's American Depositary Shares (ADS), the companies said.

Axis Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create a roughly $2 billion player in the London specialty market. The deal, expected to close in the final quarter of the year, will add to Axis' earnings in the first year and allow it to bulk up in the Lloyd's insurance market. It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. Axis is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees, John Hastings-Bass, chairman of Novae, said. Axis operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America.The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid.Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a torrid nine months for the company. The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price, Neptune's Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae's shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain's Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune's view.Insurers have been preparing for a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as valuations in the Lloyd's insurance market became more attractive to overseas buyers due to a fall in the value of the pound after Britain voted to leave the European Union.Lloyd's companies such as Hiscox (HSX.L), Lancashire (LRE.L) and Beazley BEZG.L have long been seen as acquisition targets, and insurers Amlin, Brit and Catlin have all been snapped up by overseas insurers in recent years.

Air India's international operations would bring a very important element to our network, Rahul Bhatia, co-founder of IndiGo, said on a call with investors. It would provide rapid entry into restricted and in some cases closed international markets.IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe (INGL.NS), last week expressed interest in buying a stake in state-owned Air India, after India's cabinet gave in-principle approval to privatize the carrier. Shares in IndiGo fell as much as 5.6 percent the day after this announcement, with analysts citing concern about such an investment given Air India's heavy debt burden. We continue to like Indigo for its efficient cost structure and balance-sheet strength. However, potential acquisition of AI may create an overhang on the stock, Joseph George, analyst at brokerage firm IIFL, said in a note published last week. Air India, once the country's biggest airline, has seen its domestic market share slump to 13 percent as private rivals such as IndiGo and SpiceJet (SPJT.BO) have expanded.Air India's businesses include domestic flights, repair and maintenance operations and hotels. But its most sought-after asset is landing slots on international routes. The possibility of the government writing off part or all of Air India's $8 billion in debt could increase its appeal. Bhatia said that the company's operations would require significant restructuring. He also said IndiGo would not be willing to take on any debt that could not be supported by a restructured Air India operation. The carrier is also wary of doing a deal if the government holds on to any minority or majority stake in Air India.Low-Cost, Long-Haul IndiGo, which flies four of every 10 Indian domestic passengers, launched in 2006 and has expanded rapidly in India's booming aviation market, prioritizing domestic routes. In May, the carrier said it planned to start flying smaller planes to second-tier towns and cities this year, giving a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme to make it cheaper for people to fly within India.IndiGo has a fleet of 131 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 aircraft, and has placed a provisional order for 50 ATR 72-600 aircraft from European turboprop maker ATR for regional flights. Even without any deal with Air India, IndiGo plans to enter the long-haul international market, Rakesh Gangwal, co-founder of IndiGo, said.It makes fundamental economic sense for us to enter the long-haul international market. India's market is significantly underserved in non-stop international destinations, he said, adding that IndiGo would do so with a low-cost model.

Symantec is paying an undisclosed sum for the Tel Aviv-based company of about 40 employees. Fireglass specializes in an area of security called browser isolation, a technology that creates virtual websites allowing users to browse any content without having viruses touch their network. Browser isolation is an area that Symantec had been looking to enter for some time, Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview. He cited a Gartner report that projected that 50 percent of enterprises would adopt browser isolation by 2021. Healthcare companies, financial institutions, government and telecommunications firms have been early adopters of the technology, he said. While it's what I would call a 'tuck-in' acquisition, it will be very valuable to us as we bring it to our customers, Clark said.

While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of the deals, they could lead to fines of up to 1 percent of global revenue for Merck KGaA and General Electric, and up to 10 percent for Canon.GE was charged with providing misleading research and development information related to its takeover of Danish rotor blade maker LM Wind this year which secured the EU green light in March. GE's research involved an offshore turbine that generates more than 10 megawatts, larger than the 6-megawatt offshore version that GE currently sells and that it acquired in its purchase of power assets from Alstom.The research was deemed relevant to both GE's purchase of LM Wind and Siemen's purchase of wind turbine maker Gamesa. The commission and GE are discussing the objections and potential fine, a process expected to last until September or October, according to people familiar with the case.GE spokesman Jim Healy declined to comment on details of the information GE did not put in its initial application, but said the company responded forthrightly to the EU's concern and that GE is having constructive cooperation with the commission.

Despite strong initial public offerings, overall equity capital deals fell 12 percent to C$26.9 billion in the first half from a year ago, the data showed. JPMorgan (JPM.N), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) took the top three spots in the M&A; league tables rankings, while Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), TD and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) were the top three advisers on Canadian equity issues in the first half of 2017. Canadian companies and pension funds have been seeking investment opportunities outside of Canada, and that is expected to keep M&A; bankers busy in the second half. We see the financial buyers - the pension plans, asset managers - continually active outside of Canada, said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada. The two biggest energy deals of the year so far were Cenovus Energy Inc's (CVE.TO) roughly C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) oil sands and natural gas assets and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) sale of most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion. The large international majors are looking to delever their balance sheet and sell non-core assets, said Peter Buzzi, co-head of Canadian M&A; at RBC. And for many of them, it appears Canada falls into that non-core category, he added. Canadian IPOs, which have been rebounding after a quiet 2016, rose to C$3.4 billion, the best first half in 11 years. The IPO pipeline looks strong, said Benoit Lauzé, head of equity capital markets at CIBC. There would be very significant appetite for good technology names, he added. Kinder Morgan Canada's (KML.TO) C$1.75 billion IPO and Canada Goose Holdings Inc's (GOOS.TO) offering were some of the highlights in the first half.

Under Hong Kong regulations investors only have to disclose stakes when they move through a whole percentage level. Elliott filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong in July last year against BEA, the majority of the bank's directors and its CEO and chairman over a share placement the lender made to Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC). The lawsuit is the latest in a long-running and escalating dispute between the New York-based hedge fund and the tycoon-owned Hong Kong bank. As a long-term shareholder, we continue to believe that there is the potential for significant shareholder value to be unlocked at BEA, when there are fundamental and substantial improvements to corporate governance and the overall management of the bank, an Elliott spokesman said. BEA declined to comment on the increase in Elliott's stake. BEA has said previously it will vigorously oppose Elliott's lawsuit, saying it went against the interests of the bank and its shareholders.

This, along with weak energy prices have hurt Russia's economy although a weakening of the rouble RUB= to above 60 a dollar in the last quarter, close to the level it was at the start of the year, has made Russian assets more attractive. There has been a pickup. I think it was largely on the back of (an) improved economic outlook, rather than (an) easing geopolitical environment. People have got used to the sanctions, Alexei Yakovitsky, global CEO at Russia's VTB Capital (VTBR.MM) said. VTB Capital is in third place in the adviser rankings, behind U.S. bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Deutsche. Deals by overseas buyers in Russia make up more than half of all transactions done so far, with a slowdown in domestic M&A; pushing the total value down to $7.5 billion from $10.3 billion in 2016. Last year's figure was boosted by state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) buying its own shares from state development bank VEB for $2.02 billion.

I don't necessarily expect there will be tremendous growth to pre-crisis levels, a senior banker at a major investment bank based in Moscow told Reuters.

China Literature Ltd requested the unusual exemption from the Hong Kong bourse, saying revealing the three executives' stakes would attract unnecessary attention amongst Tencent's employees and would likely create an unfavorable and political working environment which would significantly distort Tencent's workplace culture and distract them from their business duties within [Tencent] as well as their duties as directors of our Company. The online publisher filed for a Hong Kong IPO on Monday. The three executives are its board members and would have to disclose their stakes in Tencent as per the city's listing rules. The waiver request will now be vetted by the listing committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange.That's an outrageous waiver request, and I hope that the listing committee will reject it, said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist and a former director of the Hong Kong stock exchange. It is the thin end of a nasty wedge if the listing committee allows companies not to disclose directors' shareholdings in their parent company. Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, said it would set a bad precedent to grant the exception. Tencent and China Literature did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK), which operates the stock exchange, said the firm has a general policy of not commenting on individual companies. China Literature asked for a waiver so it does not have to reveal the stakes held in Tencent by James Gordon Mitchell, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Tencent's chief strategy officer; Cheng Wu, CEO of Tencent Pictures; and Lin Haifeng, general manager of the merger and acquisitions department at Tencent Science & Technology (Shenzhen) Co. The three are non-executive directors in China Literature's nine-member board, with Mitchell also acting as chairman. They hold an insignificant percentage of share capital in Tencent, the filing added. But with a market capitalization of nearly $330 billion, even a tiny stake in China's biggest social network and online entertainment firm would make the executives multi-millionaires. In its 2016 annual report Tencent disclosed the stakes held by Chairman Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, President Lau Chi Ping Martin, or Martin Lau, and four independent non-executive directors. The value of the stakes ranged from $29 billion for Ma to as low as $126,348 for one of the independent directors. As in most markets, shareholders owning 5 percent or more of any stock must be disclosed to the Hong Kong stock exchange and under listing rules IPO candidates must also reveal the interests and short positions their board directors hold in the issuer itself or associated corporations.Publicly listed companies must also disclose the interests and short positions of their CEOs and all directors in shares and debentures in the companies themselves or associated corporations under a separate rule, the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO). That means even if China Literature were granted the waiver, it would still have to reveal the stakes at a later date. The listing committee has no powers to waive SFO obligations, so as soon as the company is listed, they would have to file disclosures, which will be available to the public, investor Webb added. So not including them in the prospectus would only delay disclosure. Reporting by Elzio Barreto; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and David Evans"

One of the people said that differences over using SCB's vast branch network to sell insurance products after the completion of the deal was partly responsible for the stalemate between the two companies. The person declined to give details. It was not immediately clear if the Thai bank will relaunch the sale. Both SCB and FWD declined to comment, while the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. At $3 billion, the acquisition would have been the largest ever insurance M&A; transaction in Southeast Asia, and the biggest in Asia since August 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. Insurers in Asia have been looking to expand the so-called bancassurance tie-ups - or leveraging bank branch networks for distribution - as opposed to the traditional agency model to tap into the region's fast-growing insurance market. The takeover of the unit would have helped FWD expand its existing wholly owned insurance business in Thailand, which started in 2012 and had total assets of about 74.7 billion baht ($2.2 billion) at the end of 2015. The SCB unit, SCB Life Assurance, ranks among the top Thai insurers. It had net premium earnings of 48 billion baht and net profit of 5.8 billion in 2014, as per financials available on the SCB Life Assurance website. Reuters had reported in January that Hong Kong-based AIA Group, Manulife Financial Corp, and Prudential Plc were among insurers weighing a bid for SCB's unit.

The two companies facilitate payments by linking stores to customers' bank and credit-card accounts.It's a pretty sticky product, said Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group. Once merchants find a processor that works for them, they are unlikely to change. Merchants aren't in the business of payments, they are in the business of selling stuff.Vantiv started as a project inside of Cincinnati-based regional lender Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) during the Nixon era. Worldpay, headquartered in London, was launched by a British lender in 1989 and absorbed into Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).Both companies were spun out of their banks after the financial crisis and thrived on their own continents. Now they are poised to become the singular middleman for more sales globally than any other wholly-owned merchant payments processor based on the $1.3 trillion worth of transactions they handled in 2016, according to data from The Nilson Report.The next largest, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), had looked at Worldpay but ultimately did not put in a bid, a spokesman said. Buying Worldpay would have helped JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, expand outside of its home country where it has been getting about four-fifths of its merchant business. Infographic ID: '2sN7LvJ'   The Vantiv-Worldpay deal comes at a time when more purchases are being made online, and the payments industry - long considered a backwater of banking - is facing fresh competition.PayPal Holdings Inc's (PYPL.O) Braintree, Amsterdam-based Adyen and San Francisco-based Stripe Inc are among the newcomers trying to disrupt the way merchants get paid. They have managed to secure deals with high-profile technology companies including video-on-demand platform Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), ride-hailing app Uber and streaming music service Spotify.Despite the buzz surrounding these companies, they represent a small slice of the market.In the United States, for example, the top 10 processors account for about 90 percent of transactions, according to estimates from Mizuho Securities. They are mostly big banks or companies like First Data Corp (FDC.N), which also grew out of the banking industry.Even with that much concentration, big players want to get bigger to gain economies of scale, said one investment banker to the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The banker predicted more traditional companies will combine, while newcomers remain independent because their stocks are much more highly valued.Once processors have the scale of big banks, the real competitive advantage comes from allowing merchants to sell products through any channel to customers anywhere in the world, analysts and executives said.Future mergers could be driven by a need to access new geographies or improve digital offerings, similar to the rationale behind Vantiv buying Worldpay, the banker said.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 4 spelling of Cincinnati)Reporting by David Henry and Anna Irrera; Additional reporting by David French; Writing by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Leslie Adler"

The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) posted the public portions of “living wills” submitted by banks including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Introduced in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, the plans outline how banks would go bankrupt without needing a taxpayer bailout. (bit.ly/2urLrdc) Regulators will scour the documents to make sure they are credible. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the federal government has the power to carve up a bank if regulators do not believe its plan is workable and in recent years they have faulted more than a dozen banks for drafting overly optimistic or not credible plans. The Fed and the FDIC gave insurers AIG and Prudential Financial until the end of next year to submit their living wills from an original deadline of the end of 2017. The extension was given to enable the companies to incorporate any guidance regulators may provide on their plans. Regulators also posted plans from Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), State Street Corp (STT.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). President Donald Trump wants to relax the living will process, reducing the frequency of having to submit a plan to once every two years and also give the banks more guidance on what to submit. He also wants to eliminate the role of the FDIC in reviewing the living wills.The living wills are separate from the Fed's stress tests, where banks demonstrate stability by showing how they would withstand economic shocks in hypothetical scenarios but failing either process is a black eye for bank bosses.

Global Appeal Slideshow (2 Images)Analysts say the most likely target is Worldpay's e-commerce business, especially outside the United States where Vantiv is largely focused. Worldpay says it supports 400,000 merchants in 126 currencies across 146 countries.While Vantiv owns one of the most enviable U.S. acquiring businesses - over 30 percent of revenue from integrated channels - it has no exposure outside of North America, Cowen analysts said.Worldpay's e-commerce payments revenue, which accounts for more than a third of its total, rose by 21.7 percent to 386.6 million pounds in 2016, driven by new business wins and strength in its global retail and digital content units. Analysts at Berenberg said before the announcement that Vantiv - as well as JP Morgan, is suffering from excessive exposure to the offline U.S. market. The acquisition of Worldpay would give them international e-commerce capabilities that they would be able to cross-sell to their U.S. client base. Increased exposure to the United States would also help Worldpay, which reported a lower than expected rise in 2016 revenue, hurt by weakness in its American business which accounts for more than a quarter of its revenue..

Eliminating duplicated costs in the United States will no doubt play a central role, but even so the goal appears ambitious. There are a couple of other niggling concerns. One is why JPMorgan decided not to bid. Another is that Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker and his Worldpay peer, Philip Jansen, will jointly run the company. Such setups can be a recipe for conflicts and muddled visions. However, neither is as worrying as investors’ knee-jerk reaction to the deal. Vantiv shares fell as much as 5 percent from their previous close, before recovering slightly later. The less enthusiastic investors in the U.S. company are about the deal, the less appealing it becomes for those who own its British peer."

Jana founder and managing partner Barry Rosenstein wrote in a letter to EQT's board of directors that the company was overpaying for Rice Energy and that the activist hedge fund's proposal would deliver more value. Jana disclosed a 5.8 percent stake in EQT on Monday, saying that it believed EQT shares were undervalued and it would vote against the Rice Energy deal.EQT announced on June 19 that it would buy Rice for $6.7 billion in cash and stock, which would create the largest U.S. natural gas producer at a time when American energy firms are pumping in money to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. A Rice acquisition would result in EQT paying away more than the value of the transaction synergies, the majority of which are questionable, Rosenstein said in the letter, which was disclosed in a securities filing. The Rice deal would give away $1 billion in EQT shareholder value, according to the hedge fund, which also questions the assumed $2.5 billion of cost synergies in the Rice Energy deal that EQT envisions can be achieved. When asked about the Jana letter, EQT said it stands by its Monday statement that the company seeks to maintain an open dialogue with investors and respects their opinions. Rice declined to comment.EQT has also said that there is a sum-of-the-parts discount associated with the company's valuation, which could be addressed by separating its pipeline operations. EQT said it has committed to evaluating options and devising a plan to address this discount by the end of 2018. Under the Rice Energy deal, EQT's pipeline arm, EQT Midstream Partners LP (EQM.N), would ultimately assume Rice Energy's pipelines. Analysts at Mizuho Securities estimate these Rice Energy pipeline assets to be worth around $1.3 billion. Among Jana's concerns is that extracting the maximum amount of value from the Rice combination would take too long.If EQT were to consummate this (Rice Energy) transaction, the company would potentially be required to put off a separation for two years to avoid 'built-in' tax gains for certain Rice assets that would be part of a spinoff, Rosenstein wrote in the letter. U.S. tax rules penalize companies that acquire assets and then spin them within a two-year window.

The people said Oaktree would pay 170 million reais ($51 million) for Light SA's 16 percent stake in Renova and spend another 1.2 billion reais to dilute Renova's controlling bloc. It also involves the refinancing of Renova bank loans maturing this year, freeing up collateral, the people said. Los Angeles-based Oaktree [OAKCP.UL], the world's biggest distressed debt investor, is competing with Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) for Renova. Late on Tuesday, Renova confirmed a July 3 report by Reuters that Brookfield has made a non-binding proposal for control of the company.Under the terms of that proposal, Light would get 200 million reais for the stake it has in Renova, which would also get 800 million reais in fresh capital. Newfound interest in Renova underscores a view among foreign investors that Brazil's renewable power industry remains resilient even as consumption suffers with the country's worst recession ever. Peer Omega Geração SA could raise up to 2 billion reais in an initial public offering slated to price this month Renova and Oaktree, which oversees about $100 billion in assets, did not have an immediate comment. Light declined to comment. Units of Renova (RNEW11.SA), a blend of Renova's common and preferred shares, have jumped almost 30 percent since January 2 when Reuters first reported that the company could be taken over. That compares with a 4.5 percent gain in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP. According to one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, both non-binding bids from Brookfield and Oaktree would give equal treatment to minority shareholders. The so-called tag along will be based on the proportion of common and preferred shares contained in Renova's units - the company's most widely traded class of stock, the person said. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. By injecting capital, a new buyer would give Light (LIGT3.SA) the chance to exit Renova and reduce the stakes held by the other two members of Renova's controlling bloc - CiaEnergética de Minas Gerais SA (CMIG4.SA) and RR Participações SA.Cemig and RR Participações declined to comment.A transaction with Oaktree could reduce Renova's short-term debt by 6 percent while bolstering capital at least 13 percent, depending on the conclusion of the Alto Sertão III windfarm project, the same person said. Oaktree could opt to refinance Renova's short-term debt or just a loan with state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA, the person said.Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc (SUNEQ.PK) collapsed weeks before the latter filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.Reuters first reported in April last year that Renova has been looking for a partner and fresh capital.Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; editing by Diane Craft"

The retailer joins American Apparel LLC, Payless ShoeSource Inc and other chains in bankruptcy as shoppers increasingly buy online, turning away from brick-and-mortar specialty shops and department stores, where True Religion makes the majority of its sales. In court papers, a True Religion executive pinned the company's financial difficulties on the growth of athleisure, a move away from denim to casual sports clothing outside of the gym. True Religion became a part of popular culture a decade ago as celebrities donned the denim and hip hop artists cited the brand in songs. Under True Religion's plan, its lenders will receive most of the equity in the reorganized company, whose debt load will fall by $350 million to $140 million. The company aims to exit bankruptcy in about four months, according to court papers.True Religion's owner, private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, has also approved the company's bankruptcy plans.We are taking an important step to reduce our debt, reinvigorate True Religion's iconic brand and position the company for future growth and success, True Religion Chief Executive John Ermatinger said in a statement.The company's restructuring plan provides for full payment of claims of its continuing trade creditors, which includes vendors, suppliers and landlords. True Religion has 128 retail stores, whose sales make up almost 75 percent of its total net sales for its most recent fiscal year. The company also sells its denim through department stores including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Sakes Fifth Avenue. The Manhattan Beach, California-based retailer secured a debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan from Citizens Bank for up to $60 million. The premium denim maker filed its Chapter 11 petition in U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware.

Playing down concerns that lawsuits filed by some bondholders could derail the agreed deal, Ricardo Mourinho Felix told a parliament committee that European Union banking supervisors and the EU directorate general for competition were aware of this tentative timetable. At the moment, we expect that the bond swap process, to be announced soon, will be concluded during the summer, so that the sale can be finalised by November, he told lawmakers. The bond exchange process is being prepared right now. The government has said that an August deadline initially set by Brussels to sell Novo Banco ceased to exist in March when Portugal reached a preliminary agreement for Lone Star to buy the lender in exchange for a 1 billion euro capital injection. The key condition of the deal is a so-called liability management exercise, or a bond swap, that the bank has to perform to generate additional capital worth 500 million euros. EU authorities will also still have to approve a restructuring plan for Novo Banco for the sale to go ahead as planned. Novo Banco was carved out of the country's biggest ever bank collapse in 2014 after a 4.9 billion euro rescue operation of Banco Espirito Santo. A group of bondholders led by U.S. fund BlackRock have sought an injunction to block the sale, fearing it would damage their claim to be compensated for an estimated 1.5 billion euros in losses suffered on Novo Banco bonds.

While stricter legal scrutiny related to the corruption scandal helped slow second-quarter M&A;, bankers said funds and multinational firms were still seeking Brazilian assets. Despite economic and political headwinds, merger activity could be reignited by falling borrowing costs and an increasingly stable currency.Pressure from creditors could also speed up asset sales by companies restructuring almost 180 billion reais ($56 billion) of debt, bankers said.M&A; is relatively resilient to the macroeconomic andpolitical environment as strategic players seek opportunities with long-term potential, said Patricia Moraes, head of Brazil banking for JPMorgan Chase & Co, which topped Thomson Reuters local advisory rankings last quarter. Uncertainty surrounding the timeframe for an economic recovery from Brazil's worst recession on record, as well as concerns about the stability of President Michel Temer's administration, have deterred some buyers and sellers from committing to deals. Companies announced $7.052 billion worth of Brazil-related mergers last quarter, down 76 percent from the prior quarter, the rankings showed. A year earlier, when tougher due diligence procedures were implemented, announced M&A; deals totaled $6.861 billion. Last quarter, the number of announced deals fell to 132 from 141 in the prior three months and 135 a year earlier. Brazilian markets tanked in mid-May after members of the billionaire Batista family accused Temer of seeking to obstruct the massive corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash. The market turmoil compounded the impact of Brazil's recession, keeping buyers and sellers at odds over valuations. Temer has called a corruption charge filed against him by Brazil's top prosecutor a fiction as he faces possible removal from office. Fallout from Operation Car Wash has led to increased due diligence concerning companies ensnared in the scandal, such as building group Odebrecht SA. Usual timeframes for such proceedings have doubled over the past year, to up to six months. Deals are going though an adjustment, said Alessandro Farkuh, head of M&A; for Banco Bradesco BBI SA. There's a lot of work but, because of the country's situation, M&A; negotiations are taking place in an unusual way.Consolidation More assets are on the block as companies seek to cut debt or improve their capital and tax structures, said Eduardo Miras, co-head of Brazil investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co, Brazil's No. 1 M&A; bank this year.Some companies are being forced to sell, Miras said. Opportunistic buyers and strategic players with a long-term view find themselves with a flurry of good Brazilian assets. Car Wash-related M&A; deals include J&F; Investimentos SA's planned sale of a dairy producer and the maker of the popular Havaianas flip flops, Alpargatas. Members of the Batista family, which controls J&F;, admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians.Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itaú BBA SA, said he expected deals to pick up in the third and fourth quarters amid growing interest from multinational firms and buyout funds, which are more likely to meet buyers' prices for attractive companies. Some premium assets are being sold because of the current situation, which in general keeps us excited about the dealflow ahead, Greenlees said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley topped value rankings for the second quarter and the first half, respectively. JPMorgan worked on Itaú's $2 billion purchase of a minority stake in brokerage XP Investimentos SA. Itaú BBA led the rankings for the number of deals after working on seven transactions last quarter and 18 this year. In the first six months, the total of 273 Brazilian M&A-related; transactions was worth $36.177 billion, more than three times the amount recorded in the same period of last year, the data showed.   For years, investment banks have derived nearly half of their annual Brazil revenues from M&A; advisory.

Martua Sitorus and Peter Sondakh, two of Indonesia's richest men, were in advanced discussions with FGV and its controlling shareholder, Malaysian state-owned palm planter Federal Land Development Authority (Felda), to buy the equity stakes, the sources said.But the talks have ground to a halt following a boardroom tussle and corruption claims at FGV that led to the CEO's suspension and the resignation of its chairman last month, the sources said on Wednesday. It's clear when you have the two top executives of a public listed company suspended, surely you wouldn't move beyond its daily operations, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. It was not immediately clear if or when talks on the stake sale will resume and if or when the CEO's suspension would end.A deal could have boosted FGV's finances and given it a chance to reverse at least some of the 70 percent declines seen in its share price since its IPO in 2012. The stalling of the potential deal is a setback for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who is racing against time to appease FGV's shareholders - a key vote base - before general elections that could be called as early as this year.FGV's shareholders - a chunk of whom are small landholders called settlers - have been hit hard by the share drop, worsening financial performance of Felda and FGV and delayed payments. An FGV spokesman said the company cannot comment on the matter. Sitorus' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Satrio Tjai, managing director of Sondakh's Rajawali Group, said he had not heard about these discussions. The sources did not want to be named as they were not authorized to talk to the media. Details of Plan Sitorus is the co-founder of Singapore-listed Wilmar International (WLIL.SI), the world's largest palm oil processor, while Sondakh controls plantation-to-mining conglomerate Rajawali. Under the planned deal, FGV would first take over Indonesian palm plantation assets of Sitorus and Sondakh and pay for it through significant stakes in the enlarged FGV, the sources said.Felda and Sitorus would hold about 25-30 percent each while Sondakh would own 16 percent. Felda would also take back the Malaysian land it had leased to FGV before the latter's IPO in 2012, paying about 4 billion ringgit ($931.53 million) in cash, one of the sources said. Eventually Sitorus will helm FGV, which at the completion of the deal would be a company with mostly Indonesian assets. FGV would essentially be upstream Indonesian assets, said a banking source familiar with the discussions. According to the first source, the company is also open to others who may be interested in an FGV stake.Sondakh, who has long-standing ties to Prime Minister Najib, had tried to sell to FGV a stake in his palm oil firm PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk (BWPT.JK) in June 2015, but the plan was scrapped after FGV shareholders blasted the deal as too expensive. The Eagle High stake was eventually bought by another unit of Felda last year at a 95 percent premium. Najib is keen to fix FGV, whose problems are hurting his image among key Malay voters. The settlers' communities account for nearly a quarter of all parliamentary seats. By conservative estimates, UMNO could lose at least 5 seats in Felda constituencies... A bigger UMNO loss - up to 10 seats - is entirely probable, said Gavin Browning, a Singapore-based analyst with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, referring to Najib's United Malays National Organisation party.Additional reporting by Cindy Silviana in JAKARTA; Writing by A.Ananthalakshmi; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman"

The EU competition authority has not asked rivals and customers to comment on the plans, a person familiar with the matter said, indicating that it is set to open a full-scale investigation lasting about four months when a preliminary review ends on July 24. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Knorr-Bremse said it was aware of regulatory concerns. There are indications that the EU Commission might initiate a Phase II investigation, and Knorr-Bremse takes a confident view on a potential Phase II investigation, the company said. The Knorr-Bremse bid faces strong headwinds after Haldex's management pulled its support. Haldex Chairman Jorgen Durban told Reuters that the company received signals from the regulator that the deal stood only a slim chance of getting clearance. Knorr-Bremse, which has a Haldex stake of just under 15 percent, is hoping to win over Haldex shareholders at an extraordinary shareholder meeting.

The Snapdeal board rejected the bid as it was below a valuation of $1 billion indicated earlier by Flipkart, two sources familiar with the negotiations said. One of the sources said the bid came in at between $850 million and $900 million, while a second source said that the bid came in closer to $850 million. Flipkart had estimated Snapdeal, which is operated by Jasper Infotech, to be worth $1 billion in a non-binding term sheet which was to be followed by due diligence, one source said. Snapdeal opened its books to Flipkart in May for the company to run the due diligence process on it. Japan's SoftBank, Snapdeal's biggest investor, is keen to fold the e-commerce firm into Flipkart and take a large stake in India's biggest e-commerce player through an all equity deal. A merger will help Flipkart, which is already backed by Microsoft Corp, China's Tencent and online auction site eBay, bulk up and stay ahead of Amazon, which is expanding rapidly in the world's fastest-growing internet services market. Flipkart, Snapdeal and their key investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The due diligence, run by auditor Ernst & Young and law firm Khaitan & Co, came up clean, but Flipkart knocked down the price without a reason, said the first source, adding that Flipkart's top investor Tiger Global indicated that it would revert with a new offer. The exclusivity period around talks with Flipkart ended on July 2, however, and Snapdeal could engage in talks with other interested parties, said the source.The second source said Flipkart's lowball offer was just a negotiation tactic. Both sources said sale talks between the e-commerce firms will continue, while a third source said a deal was likely to be finalized by mid-July. Flipkart has not currently bid for Snapdeal's logistics arm Vulcan Express and its digital payments venture FreeCharge, one of sources said, adding that these assets may be sold separately.

The British group plans to modernize the aging steelworks, together with Arrium's mining and steel distribution businesses,after it collapsed last year following a downturn in steel and iron ore markets. We aim to leverage the advantages of integration across the value chain, from raw materials and metal production to high-end engineered products, Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of industrial turnaround company Liberty House, said in an email to Reuters. Liberty House operates together with energy and commodities business SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance. The agreement follows a competitive bidding process that saw a Seoul-based private equity syndicate led by Newlake Alliance and JB Asset Management chosen on June 15 as the preferred bidder, only to have GFG return with a revised offer. Mark Mentha, the head of financial administration company KordaMentha, working on behalf of creditors owed more than $2 billion, said GFG Alliance had submitted a modified offer for the Arrium businesses on Tuesday night. Taking all factors into consideration, including the timeframes required to complete a sale, KordaMentha and our sale advisers Morgan Stanley decided that GFG was an option superior to the conditional offer of the Korean alliance, Mentha said. GFG provided a quicker path to completion in August. The Korean bidders needed more time than that, a spokesman for KordaMentha told Reuters separately. The Korean bid also attached more conditions, including the need to obtain A$400 million ($303.8 million), potentially from the Australian government, to keep the existing steel plant operating during the modernization work. GFG's plan was seen as cleaner, with less conditions, the spokesman added. The logo of Australian miner Arrium Ltd is displayed in the deserted reception area of their office located in Sydney, Australia, April 7, 2016.David GrayThe sale is subject to approval by Arrium's committee of creditors, which meets next week, Mentha said. 'Surprised and Disappointed' The South Korean consortium backed by POSCO, however, was still interested in buying Arrium, a Newlake official told Reuters, declining to comment on whether it would sweeten the offer, or take legal action against the decision. We are very surprised by and disappointed with the decision, the source with direct knowledge of the matter said, adding that his group was told of the decision only this morning. We made a superior proposal with competitive bid price and sustainable long-term post-acquisition plans. We are not sure whether the seller's decision fully reflects the best interests of all involved stakeholders, including the employees and regional economies, said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. He said its plan to introduce POSCO's Finex steelmaking technology would enable Whyalla Steelworks to post an annual profit of A$100 million to A$200 million for the next 30 years, creating jobs and reviving the local economy. The Finex steelmaking technology helps cut costs and emissions. Arrium collapsed in April 2016 with A$2.8 billion ($2.13 billion) in debt after creditors rejected a $927 million bailout proposal by private equity group GSO Capital Partners that would have paid no more than 55 cents on the dollar on their claims. A purchase price was not disclosed. However, both bidders indicated during the sales process that they were prepared to spend more than A$1 billion upgrading Arrium's Whyalla steelworks in South Australia state and on its mini-mills, steel distribution and iron ore mining divisions.Australian treasurer Scott Morrison said he expected to clear the transaction with the federal government's Foreign Investment Review Board later on Wednesday.

Ocado Chief Executive Tim Steiner said Amazon's purchase of the upmarket grocer had made existing bricks and mortar supermarket players in the United States think harder about the competition they will be facing in the coming years. Therefore we’ve seen increased interest in our (technology) solution from players in the U.S., he said after Ocado reported a 2.7 percent rise in first half core earnings. Ocado pioneered the use of software and automation to pick online grocery orders in huge warehouses, rather than by hand in stores.Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods has brought renewed focus on online grocery shopping in Britain, where it accounts for 7.6 percent of total grocery sales and is growing by over 10 percent a year, according to researchers Kantar Worldpanel. Ocado has a UK grocery market share of 1.3 percent. Some analysts believe the Amazon/Whole Foods deal increases the chances of an Amazon takeover of Ocado or of a partnership deal, or of other U.S. grocers seeking Ocado's technology. But others argue Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, a traditional retailer, makes Ocado its least likely UK target. We’ve never been trying to sell ourselves ... It’s not a focus of ours to try and sell the business, said Steiner. He dismissed the suggestion that Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods was an admission by the world's biggest online retailer that stores are required for food retailing. I think they (Amazon) just bought a player in the U.S. that has a very high quality recognized brand name and recognized sourcing, he said. I don’t think they know yet what their model’s going to be ... I imagine they bought it as a stepping stone towards their future ambition. Ocado, founded by three former Goldman Sachs bankers in 2000, has divided analysts like few other stocks, with some viewing its home deliveries from giant distribution centers as the future of grocery shopping and others seeing it as a costly and complicated venture that will never make sustained profits. Partnerships with retailers overseas are seen by analysts as the key influence on Ocado's stock market valuation. Last month, Ocado clinched a long awaited first overseas deal with an as yet unnamed European retailer. It said on Wednesday that deal would be the first of many. Grocery retailing is changing and we are ideally positioned to enable other retailers to achieve their online aspirations, said Steiner. Ocado, which sells products supplied by upmarket grocer Waitrose and also has its own distribution agreement with Morrisons, made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 45.2 million pounds ($58.3 million) in the 26 weeks to May 28. That was ahead of analysts' average forecast of 44.8 million pounds. Retail revenue rose 12.5 percent to 659.6 million pounds. Ocado published results for the first 22 weeks of the period last month. Shares in Ocado have had a rollercoaster ride since listing at 180 pence in 2010. They have risen 11 percent so far in 2017 and were up 0.8 percent to 291.9 pence at 0850 GMT, valuing the business at 1.85 billion pounds.

KKR Credit Advisors LLC made a $500 million bid for non-bank lender Pepper Group Ltd at an indicative price of A$3.60 per share, a 4 percent discount to Tuesday's close. Pepper shares sank 7.2 percent to A$3.48 on Wednesday. Australia's A$1.7 trillion ($1.30 trillion) mortgage market is highly profitable with very low delinquencies and lucrative commissions. Last week, publisher Fairfax Media Ltd followed rival News Corp with plans to enter the mortgage broking business which generates A$2 billion ($1.53 billion) a year in commission. The bubbling interest comes as regulators grow increasingly worried about debt levels and the capacity of ordinary households to pay back big loans on expensive houses. Property price rises, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, are also showing early signs of easing as authorities tightened restrictions on speculative investor lending. As banks back off risky lending, Pepper's Australian loan book jumped 36 percent in 2016, far outpacing the banking sector's 6.5 percent credit growth. Experts question whether this growth is sustainable.Credit growth is falling as we speak and the housing market is running out of steam, said Hamish Chalmers, who helps manage A$1 billion at Watermark Funds Management. It seems realistic to think it probably peaked some time in the first or second quarter of this year. KKR's bid comes more than two years after it bought General Electric Co's Australia and New Zealand consumer lending arm for an equity value of A$1.2 billion. Since renamed Latitude Financial Services, the company offers a similar suite of low-document home lending and credit cards to Pepper. Industry players said the two firms together will boost KKR's portfolio and create a stronger brand, making it easier for the private equity giant to then offload them at a higher value. A KKR spokesman in Australia declined to comment. Pepper trades at a relatively low multiple to the major banks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9 compared with 14.6 for top mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Pepper said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange that it had granted KKR exclusive rights to conduct due diligence, and that negotiations were incomplete. While Pepper is seen exposed to a housing correction and its delinquency rates are already well above the major lenders at 1.6 percent, Australians are seen as good creditors who will cut back elsewhere to meet their mortgage payments. If you were to look at the possibility of increased defaults, you'd have to see something to precipitate that, something that we're not seeing on the horizon: For example a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, said Jo Horton, a senior economist at St George Bank.

GSR could buy a stake of around 20 percent - worth just under $1.9 billion at current market values, one of the sources said, but added there was no firm agreement. SQM is one of just a handful of established lithium miners globally and a Chinese investment would go hand in glove with an electric car boom in the world's biggest auto market.Beijing is aggressively promoting the vehicles to combat air pollution and as a means for the domestic car industry to compete with foreign rivals that have decades more experience in internal combustion engines. The sources said GSR, which has invested in clean technology and electric cars, met the Chilean government in April to discuss the potential purchase and was now moving towards a deal.A Chilean government transparency web site reported two GSR representatives met Eduardo Bitran, the head of the government development agency Corfo that manages the nation's lithium leases, on April 24. An SQM representative declined to comment. GSR did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources did not specify who would sell the shares to GSR, but Julio Ponce, former chairman and one-time son-in-law of Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet, has previously tried to sell part of his interest in SQM. That process ended in late 2016 after offers fell short. Suitors then included Ningbo Shanshan Co Ltd, a Chinese manufacturer of lithium battery materials. Canada's Potash Corp was also seen as a potential buyer. According to a presentation on SQM's website, Ponce's holding firm Pampa Calichera and Japanese trading and chemicals firm Kowa Co Ltd, who have a joint voting pact, together owned a 32 percent stake in SQM as of the end of March 2017. Potash also owns 32 percent. Potash declined to comment. Reuters was not able to reach Ponce for comment, but a source with knowledge of Pampa Calichera said he was not aware of the potential stake purchase. Kowa did not have immediate comment. SQM, which has access to vast mineral reserves in the so-called 'lithium triangle' in Chile and Argentina, said in May it was planning to expand production as lithium demand continues to rocket on the back of its increased use in electric vehicles and mobile phones. GSR, currently managing a $5 billion M&A; fund, mainly targets foreign industrial and emerging technology companies, including electric car batteries and pharmaceuticals firms. It is in talks to buy control of a Nissan Motor Co rechargeable battery unit for about $1 billion, media have reported. GSR was also involved in a Chinese consortium to take over Italian football club AC Milan last year, but dropped out before the deal was signed, sources said at the time. It grabbed headlines in 2015 when it teamed up with other investors to buy Philips's lighting component unit for $2.8 billion, a deal later blocked by a U.S. foreign investment panel on security grounds.

In early 2017, Crockett Oaks III, Shell's former head of U.S. security, sued the company for firing him when he selected 53-year-old Michael G. Oliveri, a qualified candidate with a military background, for a security advisor job. The lawsuit, which has since been settled, alleged that Oaks was directed to hire a young, female candidate instead of Oliveri, then later blocked his hiring and fired Oaks.  Oliveri says he was denied a $114,000 job with bonuses and subsequently lost his contractor job with Shell. He is reportedly seeking damages for lost wages and legal fees.  Age discrimination is a violation of federal law and employers can face liability when they give preference to younger candidates because of their age. HR's understanding of ageism must go beyond bullying and other forms of overt harassment (even though such problems do exist and should be taken seriously). Employers may not even realize that they may be discriminating against older workers just by including certain fields on a job application. The key is to be mindful of unconscious biases when making hiring decisions and remember that seasoned candidates can often bring a great deal of knowledge and skill to a company. As older workers continue to alter the common conception of retirement planning by re-entering the workforce, HR departments across industries will be forced to confront the problem of age discrimination head on."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/tesla-to-shake-up-hr-leadership-as-employee-allegations-surface/443680/","Tesla to shake up HR leadership as employee allegations surface","","PostedMay 26, 2017","","Tesla announced a leadership change within its HR department earlier this week amid a string of public allegations from a number of U.S. and international employees, Buzzfeed News reports. Gaby Toledano, formerly of Electronic Arts, will succeed Arnnon Geshuri as Tesla's VP of Human Resources, the automotive and energy company announced in a statement. Geshuri is the third HR executive to leave Tesla in 2017, according to Buzzfeed. Tesla has been the target of several recent controversies, with employees reporting instances of discrimination, unsafe working conditions and workplace harassment. POLITICO's Morning Shift reports that data analyzed by Worksafe, a nonprofit focused on occupational safety, shows injury rates at Tesla plants were higher than industry averages in 2014 and 2015, and were similarly on track for 2016. It's important not to forget the context of the announcement, given its occurrence just months after Tesla employee Jose Moran wrote a blog post criticizing managers at a Tesla plant in Fremont, CA for alleged safety violations. Moran also called on Tesla employees to unionize in cooperation with the United Auto Workers union. Tesla leadership has vehemently denied the allegations, with CEO Elon Musk calling Moran's assertions outright false. But the controversies have grown in number since then, the most poignant being a video taken by one of its manufacturing plant workers which recorded the use of racial slurs from co-workers targeting the employee. Without diving into the particulars of each incident in depth, the takeaway for HR leaders, particularly at industry disrupters like Tesla, is the need to listen to employee complaints directly and candidly. Not even halfway into 2017, several organizations have had to deal with the fallout of poor HR practices and documentation. Incidents at Fox News and Uber immediately come to mind, but this trend goes beyond a small handful of firms. Simultaneously, ethics reporting rates have increased steadily since 2010, with nearly 1.4 reported incidents per 100 employees in 2016. More than ever, the C-Suite has been tasked with leading by example when it comes to ethical conduct. As with many processes in HR, the cure begins with culture. How should employees expect to be treated in the workplace, and to which values will management point in the event that things go south?  Some, like Google, have upped transparency and accountability, though the tech giant itself is no stranger to HR controversy. Google employees have begun meticulously documenting instances of biases and harassment encountered during the day-to-day, with 20% of staff subscribed to an email list that reports any such incidents."

In Saba’s case, Halogen expertise in performance management balance’s Saba’s learning platform to advance HR technology. In fact, Forrester Research named Saba among the top three cloud-based HR performance management and learning software providers.Acquisitions in the space last year were largely dominated by recruiting firms, including the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft and the various acquisitions made by Randstad Holdings, like Monster. Such moves are likely to continue in the new year, particularly in the learning field, which is seeing strong innovation."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/truck-driver-charges-united-van-lines-with-employee-misclassification/444842/","Truck driver charges United Van Lines with employee misclassification","","PostedJune 13, 2017","","United Van Lines LLC, is sued for allegedly misclassifying a truck driver as an independent contractor after working more than 10 years for the company, reports the Saint Louis Record. Truck driver Sammy Davis filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming the transportation company paid drivers on a percentage of the cargo hauled instead of on the amount customers paid the company. Davis also alleges that the company required drivers to pay for fuel, repairs, lease payments and other expenses and paid drivers less than the minimum wage, according to the Record. Davis said he worked 16-hour days, but was denied overtime pay. As a result, he contends that the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Missouri Minimum Wage Law. The plaintiff wants a jury trial and seeks compensation for damages, legal fees and other relief the court finds fair and appropriate.  At the core of the case is the driver's classification — a growing issue for many companies that employ truck drivers of any kind. Certain issues at hand include his length of employ and whether or not he depended on the company for his livelihood. These standards have been used to catch employers with misclassification in the past. ​According to Supply Chain Dive, drivers have been in short supply for a long time. But the driver shortage worsened with increased regulation, stricter hiring rules and drivers retiring from the vocation. This means the remaining drivers are making longer trips with larger freight. Administratively, it might make more sense for employers to classify drivers as independent contractors, since many act as independent agents, but courts have become increasingly leery of such arrangements. The gig economy, generally, continues to be a source of frustration for courts and employers. More industries are turning to gig or contract work to make up talent shortages and scale talent needs appropriately without large overhead costs. But the Uber classification debacle is an example of how widespread the practice has become — and how dangerous it is to do it wrong.  "

"http://www.hrdive.com/news/the-odd-couple-in-an-unlikely-acquisition-focus-on-merging-cultures/446192/","The odd couple: In an unlikely acquisition, focus on merging cultures","","PostedJune 30, 2017",""," When the news broke about Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition, companies in every industry stood up and paid attention. Both are huge brand names, sure. But their business models seem antithetical at every cultural level. Even beyond the obvious brick-and-mortar differences from Amazon, Whole Foods has a reputation for its employee generosity, its lackadaisical attitude toward tech and its expectations for high-quality but high-priced products. How Amazon expects to absorb such a company is anyone’s guess at the moment, but in this age of M&A, it’ll likely be more than the merger story du jour. It could provide a powerful example for how two seemingly disparate but business-aligned companies create a successful marriage — or it could be a primer on how companies may bite off more than they can chew. Cultural awareness during mergers may not be a business’ first consideration, Dawn Conrad, EVP at Aon Strategic Advisory, told HR Dive. But as legacy giants try to heal their wounds by buying the very companies that disrupted their business models in the first place, culture ought to be an early focal point for company leaders. It defines how a company does the most basic aspects of its work — and forgetting about it could spell doom for any M&A. Whole Foods CEO John Mackey isn’t exactly known for subtlety, but during a stressful time like a merger, a leader must balance honesty with a strategic approach. Anything the CEO says will be watched carefully by employees fearing the prospect of change. Mackey telling his employees that Whole Foods will become “more customer-centric” could easily be interpreted poorly, since their entire model of employee generosity posits that treating employees well leads to better customer service overall. If I was an employee, I would be wondering what that means for my job. We have this great employee atmosphere, how do we keep that? Micah Alpern Principal, A.T. Kearney “I wouldn’t state that without clarifying what that means,” Micah Alpern, a principal at A. T. Kearney, said. An example Alpern provided of how to approach that message: ‘We are going to push further and focus on customers, and that will continue by expanding a great employee experience.’ Amazon has almost the opposite reputation, being a results-oriented workplace that demands innovation at breakneck speeds. Generally, if one company is merging with another, employees will be paying careful attention to how the culture they’ve likely come to enjoy will shift. “If I was an employee, I would be wondering what that means for my job,” Alpern said. “We have this great employee atmosphere, how do we keep that?” Leaders should be carefully assessing the kinds of cultural issues that could spring up before any employees know about the merger. “Prior to the deal being announced, do due diligence,” Conrad said. “Consider high-level cultural differences and similarities. What’s the strategy and how are they going to align? Integration planning should be a key part of the assessment, to understand what those issues might be.” Exactly how two companies opt to integrate can vary wildly, from total absorption to a more hands-off approach. Either way, a company must position the culture as improving, not disappearing, Alpern noted. Getting influencers in an organization on board with any changes is an imperative part of that process. “Retention will be a key issue,” he said. “There are influencers throughout the organization. You can’t lose these people. Let them be involved, out there talking to employees as a more informal communicator.” Transparency and honesty (to a point) matter to employees. They may feel lost and will need to have some sense of how the company arrived at the M&A decision. A map provided by the employer about how certain issues will be navigated could help. Employees understand how the organization functions. If an important aspect of the organization will be shifting in response to the merger, employees will need to be told upfront how and why it will change, Conrad said. One important element to reiterate: Culture is not just perks. Culture is the actualization of the way a company handles its basic workings, such as governance, decision-making, the work environment and employee communication. The ways employees interact with each other and the business reflect those basic building blocks. Unfortunately, HR doesn’t own culture. But it can affect the factors that ultimately create culture. “I think being able to go in and understand what are going to be such strong cultural barriers that will immediately impact the business is key,” Conrad said. “Have a plan for overcoming them.” Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, sent a letter to his employees when Microsoft acquired them that is considered a strong example of communicating clearly and honestly in the face of a merger. It noted the company’s strengths, what they did well and how they would continue to harness those strengths. “No culture is perfect,” Alpern said. “But what is working? How can we leverage them and propagate any kind of change we make around them?” To get employees on board, make them feel more explicitly a part of the change process. How can each individual or department align with the new company order? How can employees participate and have their say in how you modify your company model?In other words, give people the chance to own it. It motivates employees when they can say they had the opportunity to make decisions, Alpern said. Be sure to address changes upfront and early, Conrad said. But also be aware that it won’t happen overnight. Changes like this can take years, especially when the two cultures may be disparate. Invest in the change and keep culture in forefront to make the transition as painless as possible. “It’s a matter of getting and understanding what it takes to transform,” Conrad said. “Every organization is different. Every organization is trying to create something new.”"

There’s no doubt that the brand will live on in some form or another. Matt Charney at Recruiting Daily said of the acquisition, Randstad isn’t necessarily just buying some tech partner — they’re doing a fairly traditional professional services acquisition and getting an existing book of business with recurring revenues to boot. Monster holds a lot of value not only as a job board, but as an entire suite of business tools and resources that Randstad can leverage to complete its mission. "

Now, that handed-off case has taken a new turn with the Justice Dept. signaling it's open to settlement offers, according to the Chicago Tribune. In both the $48 billion Anthem-Cigna case and the $37 billion Aetna-Humana case, the Justice Dept. sued to stop the deals because of anti-trust concerns. But in a Friday hearing, Jon Jacobs, a Justice Dept. lawyer, said the government was open to settlement offers from Anthem to resolve the antitrust lawsuit, the Tribune reports. According to the Tribune and legal experts, it's not unusual for for the federal government to consider settlement offers in some large antitrust cases. However, comments at the hearing do not guarantee an agreement will be carved out between Anthem and the government. Because the deals would cut the number of large, national health insurance carriers from from five to three (UnitedHealth Group, the largest, is the third), the Justice Dept. stepped in. As with most antitrust cases, the government fears a lack of competition and less consumer choice will result, the Tribune reports. Jennifer Rie, an antitrust analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York, told the Tribune that it makes sense the the Justice Dept. will listen to alternatives, but she didn't want to guess at what might be acceptable to the government to allow the deal to proceed, based on its initial concerns. Judge Amy Berman Jackson told lawyers for the insurers on Friday that the trial would probably begin in mid- to late November and that she couldn't rule on the case before the end of the year. From the HR and benefits perspective, consolidation could potentially negatively impact healthcare costs in terms of bargaining position. But the efficiencies, along with the expected growth of public healthcare exchanges resulting from Affordable Care Act's recent success with the Supreme Court, could also work in employers' favor."

Judge John D. Bates' ruling cited potential antitrust law violations, siding with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the Times, Bates argued the deal would have decreased competition for both Medicare Advantage plans and plans on public exchanges. He disagreed with the companies' assertion that regulation would prevent the Aetna-Humana combined firm form raising prices or reducing benefits. An Aetna spokesperson told the Times that the company is considering an appeal. The ruling comes just six months after the DOJ sued over a similar, but separate, merger between industry competitors Cigna and Anthem. Healthcare industry observers weren't immediately surprised by the ruling; federal agencies had been exchanging 'pleasantries' with Aetna officials for months, fanning the flames over an already hot-button issue given the Obama administration's commitment to regulation of the health insurance sector. HR professionals, on the other hand, might wonder what such legal troubles mean for their employees. Previously, it was speculated by some parties that employees would save as a result of the merger due to increased efficiency and the growth of public health exchanges. Of course, this point has become a bit muddied given that we still don't know what will happen to the ACA. GOP members in Congress have not agreed to a set of proposals at the time of this writing, so the fates of current healthcare exchanges are not yet known."

According to Employee Benefits Advisor, U.S. District Judge John Bates, in Washington, has decided to hand over the Anthem Inc. takeover of Cigna Corp. to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, also in Washington. Bates will keep the case against Aetna Inc.'s deal for Humana Inc. Without the move, expert say the chances for rulings on both lawsuits by year's end are minimized, and also lessens the odds that things would go south due to the complexity of two massive cases and a single judge. Given the complexity and importance of these cases, the court cannot feasibly try and decide both in that time frame, the judge wrote in a ruling. Ultimately, it will be fairer to the parties and better for the public if one of the cases is randomly reassigned to another judge in this district, who can give it prompt and full attention while this judge does the same with the other. Benefits Advisor reports that all four companies, which insure or administer a massive number of U.S. employer-paid healthcare plans, told Bates a year-end deadline is a must because of timelines outlined in their merger agreements. For employers, especially larger ones, the two mergers should have a serious impact on the health insurance marketplace. So far, no one has predicted how it all would affect employers' healthcare plan costs, though naturally merger proponents say the oft-mentioned economies of scale would work in favor of both employers and employees. The Justice Department, which is seeking to block both mergers, told Benefits Advisor both cases should be ready for February trials.

The combined companies might develop new applications for services neither currently provides, such as employee training, performance management and succession planning.

The study also found: 42% of study respondents said that company integration was incomplete, although they were less likely to describe integration as difficult; only 45% said they were “completely committed” to integrating staff; and finally, gaining access to management and technical talent while acquiring another entity is twice as important now (33%) than in 2013 (15%), but achieving that goal has decreased. If HR leads the integration of employees in company mergers, an uptick in the success rates might occur. HR is the expert in motivating, training, developing and engaging employees.

Employees likely were distracted by the massive sales day, says Business Insider. But it also probably cut into the time they spend on Reddit, Facebook and other social media platforms while at work. Prime Day's popularity reflects the growth in online shopping in recent times and an expansion beyond the traditional Black Friday structure (which, of course, also creates distractions at work). Employers might weigh how Amazon's Prime Day stacks up against Black Fridays, presidential elections, Super Bowl betting, March Madness and other activities that take employees minds off their jobs. Productivity losses appear largely harmless when calculated within a 24-hour time span, but they can do significant financial damage when seen as quarter-year calculations. By openly acknowledging that certain activities will distract employees while on the job, employers can remind them of their daily responsibilities, such as meetings to attend, deadlines to meet and quotas to fill. However, some events, such as March Madness or Prime Day, can be a way of creating camaraderie among workers as long as they know the time limits on these activities. Written polices that address excessive use of computers for non-work-related activity also might be necessary. Employers shouldn't hesitate to enforce these restrictions when excessive use occurs."

Before the Whole Foods acquisition, Amazon was entering the grocery market with Amazon Fresh, an online food-buying experience, and Amazon Go, a prototype cashier-less grocer based in Seattle. Mashable says Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods will force other grocery chains, such as Safeway and Kroger, to make steep staff cuts and digitize grocery-buying. Amazon also will have other grocers developing employees to be more knowledgeable about the merchandise and therefore more helpful to customers in the Whole Foods model.   Whole Foods is an upscale retail chain catering to affluent consumers whose business model Amazon might not want to change. Average grocery chains like Safeway and Kroger have a broader consumer base that they don't want to lose to a Whole Foods model.  One concern shared among experts is that the acquisition could signal a sudden, intense desire for automation in the industry, as Amazon is well-known for its willingness to digitally innovate on the fly.  Low-wage earners could be automated away with digital kiosks and the like. But like most industries facing this dilemma right now, that shift means the focus may be placed on hiring for customer service skills, so not all jobs would disappear overnight. Like any buyer, Amazon stands to inherit its acquired company's problems. Whole Foods was cited last December for denying workers bonuses they earned. In early June, an appeals court overturned the store's ban on employees' recording communication in the workplace. The bonus case, in which Whole Foods allegedly shifted labor costs to avoid paying bonuses, hasn't been settled. But the charge could cost the retailer — and ultimately Amazon — $200 million in damages, back pay and other penalties if it loses the case.  "

Raj Singh, CEO of Flock, says the partnership with Unum will ensure employers have access to a new generation of HR and benefits administration tools, as well as the ability to work with the brokers who serve as valuable trusted advisors. Flock, also part of the ADP Marketplace, is the brokers' response to formerly high-flying Zenefits, which had tried to knock the SMB broker out of the equation by dealing directly with employers. It appears the the synergy between the old and the new may work for SMB employers to be competitive with their larger brethren."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/more-advertisers-bail-on-fox-news-following-oreilly-sexual-harassment-clai/439888/","More advertisers bail on Fox News following O'Reilly sexual harassment claims","","PostedApril 6, 2017","","Major advertisers have pulled out of The O’Reilly Factor, a Fox News broadcast, following sexual harassment claims against host Bill O’Reilly, says the New York Times. A Times investigation into O’Reilly’s alleged sexual misconduct revealed multiple settlements with women plaintiffs. The National Organization for Women (NOW), the most prominent women’s advocacy group in the U.S., is pressuring Fox News to fire O’Reilly, who earns $18 million a year and whose show attracts four million viewers a night, writes the Times.Pulling out as sponsors of The O’Reilly Factor are Mercedes-Benz, BMW of North America, Hyundai, Lexus, Mitsubishi, Allstate insurance, GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer and Sanofi Consumer HealthCare. Fox stands to lose $446 million in advertising revenue. Sexual harassment claims against O’Reilly follow similar complaints against former Fox executive Roger Ailes, who resigned last year to become an adviser to the Trump presidential campaign. Other Fox male executives have been accused of inappropriate behavior, as well, in a corporate culture former female employees say tolerates sexual harassment and other sexual offenses and intimidates claimants.That's one reason why O'Reilly claiming that the women could have called HR anonymously to deal with it is a bunk argument; the culture in place wasn't going to support or investigate their claims, regardless. Employers should be investigating all allegations and changing their cultures. Ignoring sexual harassment complaints has proved to be both a legal and public relations nightmare for more than one well-known company. The ride-hailing giant Uber was slow to acknowledge similar allegations and faced public scrutiny in the process. But it eventually became proactive about changing its culture by conducting an internal investigation, replacing its chief HR executive and pledging to end practices that sustain sexual misconduct. Cultures of intimidation also must end. Employers should encourage workers to file complaints and have procedures in place to make it easier and non-threatening to do so. Having a zero tolerance culture for harrassment is a key part of this.  Employers should keep in mind the social and financial consequences of sexual misconduct allegations, too. Like advertisers in the Fox News case, consumers will pull their dollars from products and services tied to misconduct."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/uber-ceo-kalanick-officially-resigns/445506/","Uber CEO Kalanick officially resigns","","PostedJune 21, 2017","","Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO, is officially out, according to The New York Times. He earlier announced that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence, but shareholders didn't think that was enough, the Times said. Kalanick is the 15th executive to leave the company since February of this year, creating a massive leadership hole and questions over who will take over in his stead. Kalanick will remain on the company's board, however. Uber is in the midst of an existential crisis, with both its internal culture, its attempts at innovation and its business model relying on independent drivers coming under fire in recent months.  This move wasn't entirely unexpected since Kalanick announced he was stepping away early last week. But it does shine a spotlight on the mess Uber has found itself in, with problems plaguing the company on several fronts. Internally, the company has struggled to overcome its bro culture after Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, exposed the company's issues in a blog post earlier this year. Uber brought in external investigators to examine the issue and provide solutions. At least 20 employees have been fired because of the investigation so far, not including executives who stepped down in response.  Externally, Uber is at the center of the debate over independent contractor classification and exactly how far the classification can extend. The company has so far racked up a combination of wins and losses, but most recently, courts in New York slammed Uber with millions in commission payments and a ruling that claimed three drivers qualified for unemployment benefits — hinting that they could be classified as full-time employees. Naturally, these cases have raised questions about the company's future profitability. Uber is an example of a high growth company that introduced disruptive innovation internationally with its business model, but likely at the cost of its HR department. Companies that don't prioritize responsible HR practices (especially when dealing with touchy employee classification issues) risk sowing problems that simmer just under the surface until they suddenly and dramatically explode."

The move comes after a meeting president-elect Donald Trump had with Carrier officials in what some describe as a “shakedown” by Trump to encourage the company to keep 800 jobs in Indiana.Opponents of Trump’s meeting with Carrier, including the Wall Street Journal, called his tactics threatening rather than negotiations with the company based on incentives for keeping jobs in the states, but for employers it reveals potential pitfalls of internal and external communication errors. It’s not known whether Carrier viewed the Trump meeting as a “shakedown” or threat, or if the company was defying Trump with its job-shipping announcement. Fortune says the company expressed satisfaction over the “deal” and incentives discussed with Trump.  In more general terms, this situation reveals problems a company may face when external messaging and internal messaging don't quite mesh. In this case, employees were told in a company letter that jobs were still going to Mexico. The difference between the two messages could create morale problems within the workforce —especially considering the way it was conveyed. Additionally, the situation may signal how the new administration will handle company incentives and the like, meaning employers will need to pay attention."

The Times reports that just over a month ago, Cigna’s counsel told the court’s special master that the insurers’ in­house lawyers had exchanged letters “accusing each other of breaching the merger agreement,” according to a filing Wednesday in the District Court for the District of Columbia. In the case, the government requested that the insurers produce documents that discuss any breaches but both refused, saying their correspondence is privileged, according to The Times, which noted that on Wednesday the government asked the court to compel them to turn over the letters. The fact that there is hostility between the two mega-health insurers is not new. Going back to May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the courting phase of the merger was not going well. With this latest development, the government argued that the relationship between the companies ran counter to their defense in the case — that the merger would be good for competition in the healthcare sector because of billions of dollars’ in cost savings, mainly by eliminating redundancies (the typical merger promise). For employers who are either Anthem or Cigna customers, the tug of war between the two entities, along with the government lawsuit, is no doubt creating some concerns. From a strictly financial perspective, should the merger fall apart (or be blocked by the federal government), The Times reports that Anthem would need to pay Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee, according to their merger agreement. If it does eventually become reality, the deal would create the largest U.S. health insurer by members (more than 54 million) and $117 billion in annual revenue."

Flexible offices, currently a small segment of the commercial real estate industry, are moving into the corporate arena with SoftBank’s backing. Meanwhile, chief operating officer Marcus Moufarrige of Australia-based Servcorp, WeWork’s rival, is coming to New York to double ServCorp's U.S. presence, which now totals 22 locations, over the next five years. Moufarrige told Fortune the time is right for flexible workspace expansion.With smartphones and Internet access, telecommuting has proved so easy that it’s pressuring companies and landlords to offer more workplace amenities to accommodate mobility, says Fortune. But so far, traditional office space is still in demand. Businesses will not only need to consider offering flexible office space for an increasingly more mobile staff, they’ll also have to plan for less office space, brought about by an expanding gig economy that often works offsite. At present, there appears to be a transitional phase between the 20th century office and whatever the future of the corporate office is going to look like. Experts now realize the multifaceted benefits of telecommuting (aka remote work), from better work-life balance to the elimination of productivity-killing traffic. A recent FlexJobs survey rounded up the business-side of remote work benefits, which include lowering costs and retaining a more diverse group of workers. Overall, there's a strong case to be made for the perks of a flexible office. Not every organization is ready to make radical changes, and that's especially the case for larger firms. HR practitioners at more traditional workplaces should still take advantage of recommended office design updates that, though small, add a good deal to improve the employee experience."

Job gain among new companies is the lowest share of employment in 20 years.Labor Department Statistics show that the percentage of private-sector employment for job gain at new firms dropped to 1% in 2016’s first quarter, the lowest on record since 1992 when the Labor Department began keeping stats on job growth for startups, and half of what its peak once was. The addition of new jobs to the economy by startups has been steadily declining, labor statistics show. The share wavered between 1.6% and 2% in the 1990s, then inched down throughout the 80s. Even when the economic recovery began in 2009, the share went down, although it held between 1.1% and 1.3%. Commerce Department numbers show a similar decline. The decline in job gain for startups means fewer entrepreneurs are competing in business, and that’s not a good sign for the economy. Economists say it might also mean that more established firms have stiffened the competition more than ever before, which will create a great deal of trouble for HR. While economic numbers such as the jobs report have generally been good, employers should be wary of the impact of these numbers on finding the right talent at the right time."

The fitness tracking company’s chief had previously announced his company’s partnership with Medtronic, a medical technology company, in a venture involving diabetes monitoring. Fitbit has seen some struggle as of late. The company was hit with a class-action suit by angry customers alleging its wearable heart-monitoring technology wasn’t accurate, and this summer, its stock dropped from $47.60 to $8, where it still currently hovers. VentureBeat says that by forging deals with prominent healthcare companies like Medtronic, Fitbit can broaden its market beyond fitness. Recently, the company also acquired Pebble, another wearable maker.  Like most savvy business chiefs, Park wants to diversify his company. But he might run into regulations in the healthcare industry that are much stiffer than those monitoring the fitness industry. As VentureBeat pointed out, the company's entry into medical technology might raise questions from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could halt or slow production of the company’s products. Fitbit is a fairly popular brand of wearable that has made inroads in the business wellness community, especially as digital health has entered public consciousness. Whether or not Fitbit itself will continue to see success is still an unknown, but wearables and apps that seek to bridge the gap between workplace wellness and actual healthcare is a strongly developing trend. Some experts have claimed that workplaces will be more involved in digital health tracking of employees in the future, and this development certainly follows that line of thought."

Fulcher is the former CEO of Ooyala, an online video technology startup. Buzzfeed News reports that one of Fuclher's first moves is the layoff of 430 employees — accounting for 45% of its workforce.  Fulcher's appointment comes after Parker Conrad resigned as CEO last February, when it was revealed that the company tried to circumvent broker licensing rules. Davis Sacks stepped down as CEO in December, says EBA. In a public statement, a Zenefits’ spokesperson said, “Benefits administration is a cornerstone of the Zenefits platform and will continue to be. As CEO, Jay will continue to execute the vision and evolve the all-in-one HR platform, of which benefits administration is an integrated part.” Sacks' resignation had been the subject of reports toward the end of 2016, with one unnamed source saying the now former Zenefits CEO would join President Donald Trump's transition team.  In an email to employees, Fulcher addressed the difficulty of dealing with the company's upheaval to employees while praising its efforts to adapt. Following Conrad's resignation, the company announced the launch of its Z2 software platform before revamping its offerings under the HR One initiative last week. The announcement of firings, however, appears to be an indication that the company's restructuring efforts will go beyond its core software product."

Researchers said study results were inconclusive. The research did show that the gig economy is expanding and at least substituting or slowing the growth of payroll work. The study found that gig work is serving consumers’ unmet demands or generating new demands that are opening up opportunities for complementing traditional work. The rise of Uber complementing taxi-cab companies is an example. The study also showed that payroll work increased in the taxi-cab and hotel industries between 2010 to 2014.A downside for the gig industry, according to the study, is the lack of some legal protections that payroll work has enjoyed since the New Deal. Gig workers, including independent contractors, temp workers and freelancers, don’t have income security such as Social Security and other retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance or disability coverage. And anti-discrimination and minimum wage laws might not protect them, the study notes.   Several Uber workers have come forth with litigation in recent weeks, further complicating labor relations in the age of the gig economy. The drivers want protection for their wages and some of the same benefits as workers. Success for these drivers would mean that other gig workers could lodge the same or similar charges against employers.Many employers have come to rely on independent contractors, temp workers and freelancers to supplement work. But they might also need to protect themselves from gig workers’ claims with written contracts detailing responsibilities and expectations of gig workers.  "

The New York Times, through an anonymous source, reported yesterday that the DOJ is going to mount legal challenges blocking the deals, which had Aetna offering $37 billion to buy Humana and Anthem doing the same in its $48 billion bid for Cigna. Both deals, antitrust regulators believe, would harm competition in the health insurance industry by cutting the number of the largest insurers to just three. The suit takes place in nine states and the District of Columbia. Update: The Justice Department made its antitrust announcement today, and it will sue to block the mergers. Yesterday, Anthem and Cigna offered no comment and Humana didn't respond. Aetna's spokesperson told the Times “We don’t comment on rumors and speculation, but we are steadfast in our belief that this deal is good for consumers and the health care system as a whole. Of course, the mergers would have a serious impact on the health insurance marketplace for employers (large ones in particular), and by extension employees. Only the largest healthcare carrier, UnitedHealth Group, has no merger plans in the works. No one could predict how the mergers would affect costs for employers, though the merger proponents say the economies of scale would work in favor of employers cost-wise. Even back in May, there was public indication that Anthem's pursuit of Cigna faced problems. As is the case with most situations like this, the two acquiring giants are likely to fight back by making their case in court.   "
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/why-keeping-employees-in-the-loop-is-good-for-business/433058/","Why keeping employees in the loop is good for business","","PostedJan. 5, 2017",""," Following the Enron scandal, in which stockholders — including employees — lost their investments, lawmakers passed legislation requiring publicly held companies to be open about their financial dealings. Glass-Steagall and Dodd-Frank are the most notable acts requiring financial transparency. These laws take care of the public’s right to know. But what about internal transparency? Should organizations have a responsibility to keep employees informed about operational goals and strategies? There are no mandates for internal transparency, but studies show openness is what employees say they want and need to be productive and engaged in the workplace. What one study revealed BetterWorks’ Employee Sentiment survey found that a staggering 92% of workers said they would work harder if they knew what their company’s goals were. Kris Duggan, BetterWorks’ CEO, told HR Dive that this response was one of the most surprising. His firm provides enterprise companies software for raising performance based on goals, employee feedback and other data. BetterWorks teamed with Wakefield Research to survey 1,000 fully employed adults. “When employees know what projects their co-workers are working on, everyone can focus on getting the right things done,” said Duggan. He added that the approach is effective for not only promoting teamwork, but also for getting cross-team cooperation, such as marketing and IT working in unison. Another surprising result was that most employees, 64%, didn’t think goals in their company were transparent. Duggan said goals generally are not public in most companies, which he said is why the company commissioned the study. “We had already assumed the outcome – that employees weren’t satisfied with their company’s level of transparency. The survey results just affirmed our assumptions,” said Duggan. Gender differences were notable, but somewhat conflicting. While 50% of women surveyed said they would be inspired to perform better with more recognition for their efforts, only 39% of men agreed. Yet, men’s responses to other survey questions suggest that recognition might be just as important to them as it is to their female coworkers.   Duggan said this quasi-gender disparity signals to employers that they should consider the differences among employees to find a collective resolution toward becoming more transparent. So why don’t companies instinctively know that transparency is necessary, when their employees already have the problem figured out? “Leadership is following older ways of thinking,” Duggan explained. “We want to modernize companies – get them to be more open and collaborative.” He said that even two of BetterWork’s more traditional-thinking clients realize they need to operate more openly. What HR can do When asked what HR can do in 2017 to advance transparency, Duggan said the new year is a perfect time to start focusing on making goals more open and transparent. “HR should be thinking about giving employees more frequent and continuous feedback and ban once-a-year performance assessments. After 12 months, performance evaluations are less useful,” said Duggan. In fact, 80% of employees in the survey said annual performance appraisals weren’t helping improve their performance."

According to the Journal, both sides believe the issues could delay or derail antitrust approvals, which usually require cooperation for a smooth process. The deal is still expected to go through, says the Journal, but the clashes are occurring on several fronts. Mergers and acquisitions are rarely easy, but a major hurdle here is that both sides have privately accused the other of violating their July merger agreement and doing a poor job with submissions to regulators. One major issue, the Journal reports, is Anthem’s lawsuit against Express Scripts Holding Co., a prescription drug provider. The March complaint accuses Express Scripts of overcharging Anthem for drugs and seeks about $15 billion in damages. But Cigna Chairman Isaiah Harris Jr. stated in an April 9 letter to Anthem’s board that the litigation was a potential negative for regulatory approval and the combined company’s value, the Journal reported.

As previously disclosed, the merger will mean expanded distribution of Towers Watson's health care exchange and further globalization of Towers Watson's Health and Group Benefits consulting business, among other non-HR areas. Also expected, according to the official statement, is $100 million to $125 million in annual merger-related cost savings and approximately $75 million in annual tax savings. According to John Haley, CEO of Willis Towers Watson, the new company is uniquely positioned to see the connections between talent, assets and ideas and how they can lead to strong performance and growth for its clients.We intend to help our clients manage risk and engage their people in a whole new way, Haley said.

One employer, Indianapolis-based hhgregg, decided it had enough, racking up more than $70,000 a month in employment-related legal expenses. According to an article at Indiana Lawyer, the consumer appliance and electronics retailer went the request for proposal (RFP) route to cut costs and improve service, eventually choosing Ogletree Deakins, the national law firm. Charlie Young, CHRO at hhgregg, told Indiana Lawyer that Ogletree Deakins had everything his company wanted. For the law firm's part, the hhgregg deal represented a very different strategy for the way law firms typically work and charge fees. It collaborated with hhgregg to create “OD Advantage,” a flat-fee agreement for legal and employment services that the firm launched 15 years ago. Put simply, the new arrangement made it much easier for hhgregg to get its employment law questions answered, according to the article. Ogletree Deakins provided information for HR managers and employees when they needed it and solutions for both the company and workers that could help both sides avoid litigation.From the start, the program met with success. Questions were resolved in a matter of minutes instead of eight to nine days, employment claims dropped by 60% and litigation fell by 74%. More importantly, Hhgregg’s settlement amount is 27% of the national average. Cost-wise, hhgregg is spending 44% less by taking advantage of Ogletree Deakins' value-based and volume-based pricing. While Ogletree Deakins' program is not new for the firm, the bundling of services may be the future of law, especially in larger legal matters such as those faced by hhgregg, according to Chuck Baldwin, managing director at Ogletree Deakins in Indianapolis, who worked with hhgregg."

Health insurer Anthem has agreed to acquire Cigna that values its rival at $54.2 billion, the latest in a consolidation push among the United States’ biggest health insurers. The deal comes just weeks after Aetna agreed to acquire Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, for $37 billion in cash and stock. If both transactions are completed, they will shrink the number of major health insurers in the United States to three, the Times reports. A combined Anthem-Cigna would have estimated revenue of about $115 billion and serve more than 53 million people with medical coverage. Under the terms of the deal, Anthem said it would pay $188 a share in cash and stock, representing a 38.4% premium to Cigna’s closing price on May 28, before news of Anthem’s interest emerged. According to the Times report, the merger push among health insurers comes as they look to gain greater size to reduce costs and capitalize on growing opportunities in the government and individual markets. Plus, the appetite for deals among insurers was recently whetted by the Supreme Court’s upholding of the portion of the Affordable Care Act that subsidizes consumers who buy policies through the government’s online marketplace. Tucker Sharp, global chief broking officer of Aon Health, says that with rapid consolidation in the health provider space, carriers are feeling pressure to maintain their position in the game. Combining forces enables carriers to create operational efficiencies and greater scale to leverage better deals with health providers.This could ultimately results in lower costs for consumers, as well as improvements in quality of patient care, Sharp adds. But in the short term, there will be a lot of scrutiny from the Department of Justice and state regulators on these proposed deals. Sharp says it will be important for employers to follow these developments closely before determining how this merger may impact their health plans and longer-term health strategies."

Rather than an all-stock, $18 billion merger, Towers Watson shareholders will receive a one-time cash dividend of $10 per share — an increase of $5.13 per share from the original agreement.The revised agreement values the consulting firm at about $8.9 billion, based on the closing price for Willis the day before the announcement. Towers Watson shareholders, who had filed several class-action lawsuits against the Arlington, Va.-based firm, likely prompted the amendment, according to an article at Employee Benefits Network. Michael Turpin, executive vice president at USI Insurance Services, gave EBN writer Mike Nesper some of his thoughts on the Towers Watson-Willis deal. For starters, Turpin said that it is his experience that when a stock deal needs to be amended, the shareholders believe that management is letting the asset go at too big a discount. Turpin added that with Towers Watson's private healthcare exchange business, shareholders felt the company would be worth more in the next couple of years due to a potential uptick in demand (based on the impending Cadillac Tax in 2018, for one reason). And what does it mean if the deal passes muster and becomes reality? It's clearly a powerful combination, Turpin told EBN. However, the devil is in the details and the promised value creation that is multiples of the amended offer depends heavily on the execution of this combination. As with many mergers, it is always depicted as a marriage of equals — it never is."

"http://www.hrdive.com/news/how-wellness-consolidation-could-affect-employers/420640/","How wellness consolidation could affect employers","","PostedJune 9, 2016","","The wellness industry M&A trend continues to gain ground, mainly because large players are looking to add solutions to build their global footprint. But even with that trend, innovative start-ups offering unique services also have a place in the sector, according to Employee Benefits News. The article cites the Stay Well Health Management and Krames StayWell merger, and Interactive Health acquiring Health Solutions as the start of the trend in 2014. It also mentioned the 2016 Virgin Pulse consolidation with ShapeUp and the Global Corporate Challenge. Experts quoted by EBN warn that wellness industry mergers, as with any M&A deal, can be a double-edged sword for the companies merging and employer clients as well. Workplace wellness' growing popularity is not surprising, as employers who invest in their employees’ well-being are seeing several upsides including health outcomes and measurable ROI. The EBN article mentions a white paper published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine which found that 45 publicly traded companies earning top employee health and wellness scorecard results over a six-year period also outperformed the 500 largest U.S. companies listed on the S&P 500 index by 235%. Howard Kraft, a Mercer partner and North American total health management specialty practice leader, told EBN that employers who find their wellness providers entering an M&A deal should focus on the integration details of the relevant vendors, using detailed short and long-term change management roadmaps, technology platforms and people and product portfolios. LuAnn Heinen, vice president of the National Business Group on Health, says managing multiple wellness vendors is a major challenge for employers, so if an M&A deal creates more services and they streamlined on a single platform, it can be a benefit. “However, it doesn’t always work that way in practice,” she told EBN."

It’s like the wild, Wild West.” LuAnn Heinen, vice president at the National Business Group on Health, told Workforce that the large employer market is increasingly global and needs scalable wellness platforms and solutions that can be adapted beyond the U.S..  If there is successful integration of the companies, each of which had its own successful platform, that could benefit large employers. She added that the abundance of wellness startups also means a steady supply of niche solutions for employers to try out in tricky, emerging areas such as diabetes prevention, nutrition, sleep and resilience."
